It alleges that she is a Brazilian who now lives in Orlando and goes by the name Daiane DeJesus. The story cites anonymous former neighbors who it says confirmed that it is DeJesus' voice on the videos, and that she was a porn actor. It also reported that the ex-wife of DeJesus's partner confirmed that the couple is behind the YouTube account. Due to the abundance of anonymous sources and the lack of definitive proof that DeJesus is the woman in the videos, and that she was a porn star, we are keeping this Unverified.",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2958242/Brazilian-former-porn-star-Diane-DeJesus-mystery-figure-5million-year-YouTube-sensation-DC-Toys-Collector.html,No Error,"The highest paid 'performer' on You Tube, who is said to earn almost $5m a year unwrapping toys, is a former porn star called Sandy Summers, neighbours have told DailyMail.com. Brazilian Daiane DeJeus was named by a family friend as the woman behind the wildly successful collection of children's videos that have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times. And former neighbours of the mysterious internet star have revealed to Daily Mail.com her secret past - which could explain her desire to remain completely anonymous. For years they knew her as Daiane DeJesus who lived in a suburban home with her long-term partner Messias Credido. But they also discovered she was once a porn star called Sandy Summers. Scroll down for video Diane DeJesus in her porn star days (left) and at her local gas station in Orlando recently (right). The Brazilian has been named by neighbours as the woman behind the massively popular DC Toys Collector YouTube account DeJesus' videos, in which a mysterious woman 'unboxes' toys while narrating as she does so, have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times on YouTube, bringing the 29-year-old an annual income of almost $5m The Brazilian went by the name Sandy Summers but is now living under the name Daiane de Jesus Are these the hands of DC Toys Collector? Daiane DeJesus and her husband are apparently behind the site that has become a YouTube sensation Seen here with a Teletubbies toy, the woman's nails always appear differently in each DC Toys Collector video The couple behind DC Toys Collector - previously known as 'Disney Collector' and one of the most popular videos on YouTube - has gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure their identities are not known. Attempts by the New York Times and BuzzFeed website to establish their identity failed, though they were able to pinpoint Florida as the location of those behind the channel - which is nothing to do with Disney itself. But Daily Mail.com has been told the identities of the pair by former neighbours and a close friend - and has used publicly available property records. Former neighbours who listened to the videos of DC Toys Collector are convinced that DeJesus is the voice behind You Tube's most successful channel. They became aware of her career as adult film star after she was spotted taking part in a photo shoot by the swimming pool in her back garden. They also watched some of the graphic adult-only videos and instantly recognised the pouting young blonde as their suburban neighbour. DeJesus, 32, never mentioned what she did for a living and the neighbours never asked. Daily Mail.com tracked DeJesus, who quit the porn industry at least seven years ago, to her new home in an upscale gated community in Orlando, Florida. Four people who were independently shown a photograph of DeJesus taken by Daily Mail.com this week and published here said that it was their former neighbour. They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots. One neighbour who listened to the DC Toys Collector video and said immediately: 'That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere.' The neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to. DeJesus and her partner Messias Credido's old home in Winter Park, Orlando, where porn films featuring DeJesus as Sandy Summers and some of what were known as the Disney Collector videos were both made The DC Toys Collector formula is simple, with the woman simply removing the toys from their packaging, demonstrating each part and sometimes assembling them for the benefit of her massive online audience The videos are essentially a virtual tour of each toy, such as this Play Doh with a Finding Nemo theme Maribel Barreto, an associate and ex-wife of Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido, was approached by Daily Mail.com and showed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. She said they are behind the DC Toys Collector videos In the DC Toys Collector videos only the narrator's hands and the product being unboxed are usually seen This still is from the channel's most successful video, which has been viewed more than 200million times DeJesus' career change means neighbours say she is now the figure behind the most lucrative account on YouTube The user unboxes everything from Disney princesses to tubs of Play-Doh, including this Cars themed toy 'Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange. 'We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on. 'Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers' website and it all clicked into place.' His wife added: 'In the photo you have of Daiane she has put on a bit of weight but that is unmistakably her. 'That is our former neighbour. I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.' Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry. 'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said. Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. The effect [of DC Toys Collector] is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after its over.' When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away. 'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment. But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando. She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.' While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago. Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live. Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus. The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court. Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector. DeJesus as she is today, with the mole near her elbow showing she used to be the porn star Sandy Summers DeJesus was formerly well known as an adult performer (left) but now keeps a far lower profile (right) DeJesus as Sandy Summers by the fireplace thought to be at the Winter Park, Florida home The 29-year-old once made risqu videos but the market for her YouTube channel now is toddlers It is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys. Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way. Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido. Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home. 'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour. Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets. But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret. The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012. They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity. The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views. Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million. The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded. One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views. The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day. DC Toy Collector's local Toys R US store where she buys some of the products she features on her channel The branch of Target where Diane DeJesus sources some of the toys for her usually daily video posts Like others on YouTube, DC Toys Collector is able to make money from the site from pop-up and banner adverts on the site. With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos. Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid. Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed. Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned. The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m. They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count. I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute. In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice. Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'. The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features. The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting. A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them. The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes. Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'. He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'. Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute.' Others have called the DC Toy Collector 'The Toy Whisperer'. The pool and backyard area at the Winter Park house, where Sandy Summers made some of her videos according to neighbours The entrance to the gated community where DeJesus lives and is thought to make her wildly popular toy review videos DeJesus has been able to move to the exclusive area apparently thanks to DC Toys Collector making $5m a year Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida, close to where DC Toys Collector has its headquarters But the couple have gone to great lengths to guard their privacy. No phone number is listed and their names are not even on the phone entry system at the gated community where they now live in Orlando. Property records listed with Seminole County list 44-year-old Credido as the buyer of a four-bedroom home set on a cul de sac in Orlando in April 2013. DeJesus' name does not appear on the records. Neighbours in the development contacted by phone confirmed that DeJesus lives at the address and is mum to an 18-month-old boy. According to fan websites DeJesus, or Summers, began her porn career when she was 20 years old in 2006. She lists her hometown as Lages in Santa Catarina, Brazil, and her date of birth as April 1986. On a webpage called Babepedia she says: 'I was born in a small town in Brazil called Lages. I love the sun, so when I moved to the US Florida seemed like the right place. 'I miss some of my friends in Brazil, but I just love living here! I enjoy the simple life, but big cities have so much to offer; shopping for one! I am a shopoholic, definitely! 'I speak Portuguese and English. What else can I say about myself? Just that I love to get naked.' In her career she has appeared on the cover of Penthouse magazine and other adult magazines as well as dozens of graphic videos. It appears she quit or reduced her involvement in the adult film business in 2009 with one fan asking on a site: 'Anyone know what has happened to Sandy Summers?' Daily Mail.com tracked down Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido's former wife Maribel Barreto Ms Barreto confirmed that Mr Credido and Daiane de Jesus are behind the DC Toys Collector videos. She is pictured being shown a document with the reported annual income of DC Toys Collector But when asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen faced and hurried away Some of the photographs of Summers on adult sites appear to have been taken at their home in Winter Park. Many of the backdrops in the pictures are identical to those now being shown on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale. In one she is draped across a stone fireplace. That same fireplace is pictured on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale. DeJesus and Credido, who ran a now defunct photographic business called High Tec Photography, lived in Winter Park for almost seven years. The couple aroused the curiosity of neighbours as they were ultra secretive. One said: 'Messias said he was a photographer but he never left the house. They always made sure that no one would come into the house. 'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.' Another said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.' Publically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home. Daily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it. It is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos. Credido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home. Records filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced.

Originally Posted byThe nomenclature seems to have developed around the concept of IVTC filters, since the general ""best practise"" technique in computer circles is to undo any field or frame repetition in order to restore the original progressive frames in any video. Quote: As such, any video with an altered framerate is expected to undergo IVTC to restore the progressive frames and decimation to remove duplicate ones, whereas material that is truly interlaced is more difficult to decomb. Quote: Since you seem knowledgeable in this area, one thing I've yet to understand is what happens with US dramas shown at 720p60. Material on stations that broadcast 1080i60 can be restored through IVTC to achieve 1080p24 frames, but if the source is already progressive, I don't know if the frames are simply duplicated (rather than the fields), which would then mean that only decimation would be needed to restore the original framerate, or if there is a separate way to IVTC progressive content to restore its original framerate. Yes - I think because 24fps film content that has been telecined to video in the US has 3:2 pull-down that is introduced by the telecine, the addition of 3:2 pulldown (the pulldown refers to the physical act of pulling down the film during blanking on early telecines which didn't employ continuous scanning) has become intertwined with the telecine process. However 3:2 repetition can be added to 24p video, which has never been near a telecine, and in Europe we use 2:2 pull-down, where there are no duplicate fields to detect and remove/cope with.There's so much misinformation and poor explanation of broadcast video - and in particular interlacing and de-interlacing - it gets a bit annoying. Particularly when a phrase appears that is based on a standard broadcast production process (Telecine-ing is the act of transferring film to video using a telecine machine) is used to mean something else (removing 3:2 pull-down/repetition which may or may not have been caused by a telecine)Yes - though in 50i/60i they are both forms of de-interlacing. 24p/25p content with 3:2/2:2 can be restored losslessly with the right de-interlacing algorithm, whereas native interlaced content will always be ambiguous (there is spectrum folding in the vertical spatial and temporal domains that cannot be undone - though some good guesswork can be made) Obviously native interlaced 50i/60i content should be de-interlaced to 50p/60p not 25p/30p if you want to keep the full motion (i.e. temporal resolution) of the original. How you do this depends on the quality you want to achieve (particularly the vertical resolution) and the processing power you have. The best de-interlacers will use stuff like Phase Correlation Motion Compensation to detect which areas are moving, and in what direction, to create the ""missing"" fields that need to be created to generate a decent 50p or 60p result.(These processes aren't new, and in fact have been an issue in broadcast production since the 80s. High quality DVEs (Digital Video Effects devices) used in production control rooms, that zoom and shrink, rotate, page peel etc. pictures have used realtime de-interlacing to generate the highest vertical resolution pictures they can when you zoom into a live native interlaced source. If you process fields individually (which lower cost DVEs do) you end up with noticeably poorer quality results (particularly when you enlarge a picture))They're both very similar. In interlaced 3:2 you are looking for the repeated field (which will be alternating between field 1 and field 2) in a pair of source frames which you simply discard to give you 2:2 (which you can de-interlace to 1:1 with a simple field-merge - aka weave). You obviously need to continuously detect the field duplication - as 3:2 content edited in the video domain could break the 3:2 cadence (i.e. you could end up with edits that break the repeated 3:2:3:2:3:2 pattern) by comparing fields and where two are identical you discard one.The same techniques can be done in the 3:2 60p domain, but in this case you also need to detect the repeated pairs of frames as well as the repeated triple frames as you need to go from 3:2 to 1:1 without any de-interlacing. You are still detecting and discarding repeated images - but you have 3 repeated frames rather than 1 repeated field to detect per pair of source frames. With a 3:2 regular cadence 24p within 60p you detect 2 repeated frames followed by 1 repeated frame.Some compression systems optionally also allow you to flag 3:2 sources so you don't have to send redundant content (though repeated fields/frames compress quite well) so rather than sending the duplicate fields or frames, you flag them for duplication in the receiver. If you have access to the compressed stream you can detect the flags and thus recreate the 24p source without having to run any content-based repeated field/frame detection.",TBS speeds up Seinfeld a full 7.5 percent - here is the proof - AVS Forum,,Ash Sharma

NBCs most revered journalist is furious that Brian Williams is still in the anchor chair after he sheepishly admitted he hadnt traveled on a helicopter hit by enemy fire. Brokaw wants Williams head on a platter, an NBC source said. He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report. On Wednesday, Williams, 55, acknowledged that he had repeatedly said he was aboard a chopper that had been hit by a rocket-propelled grenade during a 2003 reporting trip to Iraq, when he was actually safely traveling in a different aircraft. Brokaw, 74, was still the Nightly News anchor when Williams came back from his Iraq expedition  and an insider said he knew the story Williams later spouted was bunk. Tom Brokaw and [former NBC News President] Steve Capus knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it, the source said. NBC News execs had counseled him to stop telling the tale. Williams still took the anchors seat for his Nightly News broadcast Thursday evening  and was working at 30 Rock all day despite calls for his dismissal. He didnt address the issue during the broadcast. He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News, a network source said. Many of Williams colleagues believe his claim that he simply conflated two versions of what happened in 2003. There have been meetings about it all day. They are taking it very seriously, the NBC source said. But we believe that Brians apology on the air speaks for himself. He admitted over time he conflated the events. NBC brass hasnt been talking to lower-level employees about the situation, leaving people in a panic, the insider said. NBC bosses dont understand how serious this is. Nobody in a leadership position is talking to the troops. Nobody has addressed it, the source said. One longtime NBC employee who has worked with Williams on several occasions had a few dirty words to describe the celebrated anchor, calling him a real pompous piece of st. Hes an ahole, he fumed. Hes not a journalist. Hes a reader. Oh, the fireworks that are going off inside, he said. Its embarrassing. Hes the face on NBC. Hes a liar. Everyone knew it.

It is a hoax.",http://empirenews.net/kurt-sutter-announces-plans-for-sons-of-anarchy-movie-starring-charlie-hunnam-brad-pitt/,No Error,"0 NORTH HOLLYWOOD, California  Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture. Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film Sutter said. Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jaxs father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt. I am most excited about bringing Brad (Pitt) on as John Teller, he is absolutely perfect for the role. The movie will take place from the day Jax was born, and leads up to the era just before Sons Of Anarchy began as a series. Sutter also said that he is really happy to bring Ryan Hurst back as Opie Winston, and hopes fans will forgive him for killing Opie off. Man I tell ya, when we killed Opie off, it was like the thing turned real. Ive never gone public with this, but Ive had people get really crazy when they see me in public, said Sutter. They shout at me, and they get angry  You shouldnt have killed Ope! I hope you rot in Hell!, that sort of thing. I had people try to run me off the road when they recognized me, although that just might be because Im kind of a dangerous driver. Anyway, my hope is that this film will help them cope. Sutter says pre-production on film will begin in the middle of 2015, and will begin shooting sometime in the fall. For a movie of this scope, with this much storyline attached, you should expect to see the film by the end of 2016, said Sutter. In the mean time, buy all the official Sons of Anarchy merchandise you can. Every dollar goes to helping get this movie completed.

Jess Smith, 19, was just nine months old when she became one of the most familiar faces on British television in March 1997. As the BBC prepares to make 60 new episodes of the Teletubbies, the laughing tot in the sun, who featured in all 365 episodes, has now revealed herself. Jess was selected to overlook Teletubbyland as Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po had fun below. Her decision to come out and 'say hello' came after her first week at Canterbury Christ Church university, when students were told to say something about themselves that no one else would guess. After holding back due to shyness, she eventually said: ""I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them."" Jess, a first-year dance education student, then broke the news on Facebook. She posted: ""So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.

The 19-year-old broke the news on Facebook (SWNS.com) In 1996, her mother, Anji Smith, 44, took her to Edenbridge Hospital to be weighed and a health visitor, who had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies, put Jess's name forward. Mrs Smith said it was never intended to be a big thing: ""It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was. ""They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad. ""We didn't hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she'd been picked. ""It was really weird seeing her on television."" Jess was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun. Her furniture deliverer father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera. And as no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just 250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home.",The baby from Teletubbies reveals herself,,

The email message was received by Sony's top executives on Thursday night and was obtained by CNN. The source said that the company believes the email was from the hackers because it followed a pattern of previous messages, sent to a list of particular executives and formatted in a particular way. A Sony spokesman declined to comment. Also on Friday, President Obama said he disagreed with Sony's decision. ""I am sympathetic to the concerns that they face. Having said all that, yes I think they made a mistake,"" Obama said at a White House press conference. ""We cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can impose censorship here in the U.S.,"" he added. Related: FBI: North Korea responsible for Sony hack The FBI has officially linked the cyberattack at Sony to the North Korean government. ""The destructive nature of this attack, coupled with its coercive nature, sets it apart,"" the FBI said in a statement. The Motion Picture Association of America called the hack a ""despicable, criminal act"" on Friday. ""This situation is larger than a movie's release or the contents of someone's private emails,"" said Chris Dodd, CEO of the lobbying group. ""This is about the fact that criminals were able to hack in and steal what has now been identified as many times the volume of all of the printed material in the Library of Congress."" The hacker message is effectively a victory lap, telling the studio, ""Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy."" The message also says, ""And we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately."" It warns the studio executives that ""we still have your private and sensitive data"" and claims that they will ""ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble."" The email was titled ""Message from GOP."" The anonymous hackers have called themselves ""Guardians of Peace."" Sony is still reeling from the late November cyberattack that crippled its computer systems, and now it is under severe scrutiny for canceling the Christmas release of ""The Interview,"" Seth Rogen and James Franco's comedy about an attempted assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. U.S. officials now believe North Korea instigated the hack, lending credence to the Sony executives who privately started calling it a ""terrorist act"" weeks ago. Since the cancellation on Wednesday, the same executives have been wondering whether the leaks of private emails and corporate documents would now stop. Thursday night's message implied that the leaks will stop. In a statement on Wednesday when the film's release was scrapped, the company said ""we stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome."" Many lashed out at the studio for its unprecedented decision to pull the movie. Others have rallied around Sony's predicament. George Clooney, in an interview with Deadline.com on Thursday, revealed that he had circulated a petition earlier in the week saying ""we fully support Sony's decision not to submit to these hackers' demands"" -- but no one was willing to sign it. ""It was a large number of people. It was sent to basically the heads of every place,"" Clooney said without naming names. The petition said, ""This is not just an attack on Sony. It involves every studio, every network, every business and every individual in this country,"" and it concluded, ""We hope these hackers are brought to justice but until they are, we will not stand in fear. We will stand together."" It's outdated now, since Sony did cancel ""The Interview.""

This was updated to the current claim statement, as we decided to two claims were similar enough to be merged.",First Look Media&Matt Taibbi,Jul 3,"It was made in a report by New York Magazine, which cited ""a source close to First Look.""

John Temple, First Look Media's president for audience and products told the magazine: ""I don’t comment about internal matters and I don’t comment on personnel matters. ...  I mean we’re a private company, so why would we ... no.""",http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/matt-taibbi-disappears-from-omidyars-first-look.html,No Error,"Photo: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images Matt Taibbi, the star magazine writer hired earlier this year to start a satirical website for billionaire Pierre Omidyars First Look Media, is on a leave of absence from the company after disagreements with higher-ups inside Omidyars organization, a source close to First Look confirmed today. (UPDATE: Taibbi has left the company. See statement below.) Taibbis abrupt disappearance from the companys Fifth Avenue headquarters has cast doubt on the fate of his highly anticipated digital publication, reportedly to be called Racket, which First Look executives had previously said would launch sometime this autumn. When he was hired, amid much fanfare, Taibbis website was meant to be the second in an envisioned fleet of titles to be published by First Look, an ambitious digital journalism company funded by Omidyar, the founder of eBay and one of the richest tech moguls in America. Like its counterpart the Intercept, launched earlier this year by Glenn Greenwald and others to pursue investigations of NSA surveillance and the intelligence world, it was a venture centered around a brand-name polemicist without much management experience. Prior to joining First Look, Taibbi made his name by gleefully skewering fat targets for Rolling Stone  most famously, he described Goldman Sachs as a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity  and he said at the time of his departure that he was lured away by the chance to lampoon the financial industry in the simultaneously funny and satirical voice associated with the legendary magazine Spy. Over the succeeding months, the mission of the publication broadened to encompass political satire as well, and it brought on a number of high-profile names from the New York digital scene, including deputy editor Alex Pareene, formerly of Salon; Laura Dawn, a digital video producer who formerly worked with Moveon.org; and Edith Zimmerman, editor of the Hairpin. Journalists should be dark, funny, mean people, Taibbi told New York in an interview in March. Its appropriate for their antagonistic, adversarial role. Omidyar originally conceived of First Look as a network of interlinking sites run by ""independent"" journalists, many of whom took a similarly adversarial approach to journalism. Over the last year, however, the center of gravity of the organization has shifted, as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission. Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple  a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii  to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi. The confrontational approach that made Taibbis name at Rolling Stone  and before that, as a co-founder of the gonzo Moscow expatriate magazine The eXile  appears to have contributed to internal trouble at First Look. Sources confirmed that Taibbi has been absent from the office for several weeks, only returning on one brief occasion to address the staff. Although those hired have been reassured that the project would continue on during the unspecified term of Taibbis absence, the launch date for Racket  which Taibbi indicated in September would be coming in a month  now appears to have been pushed off. We have a target date but I wouldnt make a launch date public, said Temple, who is based in San Francisco, when reached by phone this morning. I dont comment about internal matters and I dont comment on personnel matters.  I mean were a private company, so why would we  no. Taibbis absence is only the latest in a series of shifts inside First Look, which Omidyar founded last year, originally in response to the disclosures of NSA surveillance leaked by Edward Snowden to Greenwald and his Intercept colleague Laura Poitras. Omidyar initially committed $250 million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused digital magazines. In July, the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being, choosing instead to focus on Racket and the Intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism. The Intercept has lately been publishing vigorously, breaking several major stories  federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the alleged leaker responsible for a story on the site about the governments voluminous terrorist watch list. But Racket has been much slower to materialize, leading to rumors of staff anxiety. In August, Temple told me Taibbis site was experimenting with a variety of journalistic approaches  not just satire and humor but also investigative journalism. For instance, Ellen Miller, head of the campaign finance watchdog the Sunlight Foundation  a nonprofit also heavily financed by Omidyar  met with the staff over the summer to discuss how it might dig into issues of money in politics. Were supporting Matt in creating something unique  and its Matts, Temple told me. Hes building a team and theres great esprit in Matts team. Taibbis clashes with those at the top are likely to drive further speculation about the fate of the long-incubating project and about the journalists own continued involvement. Nonetheless, the site is apparently still hiring. UPDATE: Omidyar announced on Tuesday night that Taibbi has left the company.

http://www.emergent.info/ESPN-domestic-violence-panel,Culture,false,Claim: ESPN planned a special domestic violence panel that didn't include any women,Outrage ensued when reports suggested ESPN's Monday Night Football would convene an all-male panel to tackle the topic.,ESPN&NFL,Jul 3,An Esquire article on Sept 26 was misread by some to interpret that a special panel was taking place.,http://www.esquire.com/blogs/news/espn-has-a-women-problem?src=soc_fcbks,No Error,"UPDATE: The original opening sentence of this piece was widely interpreted as saying that ESPN was set to run a special panel, hosted only by men, which would address the specific subject of domestic violence in the NFL. In fact, we believed the pre-game show was to run as normal, with a segment on domestic violence. We apologize for the confusion that the language of our opening statement created and we have been told that ESPN was not planning to cover this topic in such a format and has covered domestic violence on air before with its female commentators. The first sentence and headline have been amended to reflect this change. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Additionally, we would like to apologize for saying that ESPN is not in the business of journalism. They have produced excellent journalism over the years, such as last year's NFL At a Crossroads: Investigating a Health Crisis.Kate Lewis, VP, Content Operations & Editorial Director ESPN has issued a statement in response to this story, as seen below. Statement from John Wildhack, ESPN EVP, Programming and Production Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight's Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more. Here is a link to some of those highlights. Here is a rundown of tonight's show. On Monday night, during Monday Night Football's two-hour pregame show, I thought it likely that the regular commentators were going to discuss domestic abuse in the NFL. Last week, seven men, but no women, discussed Ray Rice's punishment in the opening block of Monday Night Countdown. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24. When the show has updates from the fieldbrief reports about injuries and the upcoming gamethey'll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber. These people are not allowed at the table. On Monday, you will hear the voices of 11 men tripping over themselves to condemn the actions of one man who knocked his wife unconscious and dragged her motionless body into a casino lobby, and another man who head-butted his wife because she would not have sex with him. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below You will hear their beliefs on the commissioner who did not punish Ray Rice appropriately and whose investigation into Rice's domestic violence incident is currently unclear, and might have been intentionally obfuscated or covered up. But you will not hear these words: ""Roger Goodell is a liar."" You will not hear these words because ESPN has a $15.2 billion broadcasting agreement with the NFL. You will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both ESPN and the NFL can make. You will not hear these words because ESPN has intimidated its on-air staff into standing down against domestic violence. Last week, ESPN suspended one of its editors, Bill Simmons, for calling NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell ""a liar"" and daring his bosses to suspend him for it. They suspended him for it. Long-tenured editors and personalities of ESPN: It is now time for you to walk out with him. This is the kind of moment that separates a ""journalist"" from a ""commentator."" What do you want to be? Simmons' suspension at ESPN will last three weeksone week longer than Ray Rice's initial suspension by Goodell himself. Ray Rice punched his fiance in the face, knocking her unconscious. Bill Simmons called the head of a corporate interest a liar. His suspension is one of the longest in the history of his company. Simmons' ascendence is credited to his willingness to say sentences exactly like this. By refusing to wait in line or repeat pabulum and talking points all the way to a potential columnist job later in life, he gained an audience. The network hired Simmons to absorb his growing readership into its offshoot Page 2 section, developing a major success in spite of itself. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Simmons disabused the language of testosterone-soaked talking heads, and it worked. He avoided the intentionally adversarial outrage only created for TV ratings purposes, like the collection of recent controversies by Stephen A. Smith. Before the second, damning tape in the Ray Rice incident became available, Smith initially attempted to deflect the blame of Ray Rice's domestic incident onto Rice's fiance, Janay. [pullquote align='C'] ""What I've tried to employ the female members of my family  some of who you all met and talked to and what have youis that: Let's make sure we don't do anything to provoke wrong actions. Because if I comeor somebody else come, whether it's law enforcement officials, your brother or the fellas that you knowif we come after somebody (who) has put their hands on you, it doesn't negate the fact that they already put their hands on you."" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below [/pullquote] Smith had seen Ray Rice dragging a lifeless body out of an elevator and assumed the victim was somehow asking for it. He was suspended for one week for those comments. Bill Simmons was suspended for three weeks. Not even six weeks after returning from his suspension, Smith was back on First Take, an ESPN morning debate show, having a partial statement read to him from the National Organization for Women about Roger Goodell and Ray Rice. In the statement, NOW President Terry O'Neill implored Goodell to resign. Exactly 39 seconds after hearing her words for the first time in his life, Smith said that the President for the National Organization for Women had ""lost her mind."" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ""I'm sorry, I think this woman is off her rocker. I think she's lost her mind. That's right, I said it. This is the most ridiculous nonsense I've ever heard in my life. Roger Goodell deserves to lose his job?"" he said. ""That's crazy. That's crazy."" It was a temper tantrum. Smith was not suspended. Simmons was suspended for three weeks. ESPN has no affiliation with the National Organization for Women. ESPN has a broadcasting agreement with the NFL until 2021. Still, this week, ESPN's ombudsman Robert Lipsyte called this ""ESPN's finest hour during my tenure."" Last night, Lipsyte defended Simmons' suspension with this sentence: ""Bill Simmons has no license to call him (a liar) without more justification than 'I'm just saying it.'"" Six weeks ago, this is how Stephen A. Smith defended advocating for the discussion of ""the elements of provocation"" that could lead to a man hitting a woman: ""I don't think that's broached enough, is all I'm saying."" Bill Simmons was suspended for three weeks. Stephen A. Smith was suspended for one. In the old boys club of sports mediaone with no room for reflection and one that empowers only those who can speak about a base emotion in the fastest and loudest waySimmons succeeded by writing differently. When his contract expired, Simmons was convinced to stay after ESPN promised him his own outlet, Grantland. The site has since produced thoughtful pieces from different voicesnot just retired, bravado-filled athletes or 50-something male anchors who have paid their corporate dues, but also writers who would rather drill deep into statistics, experiment with art and new media, or write contemplatively, creatively and passionately, sometimes under pseudonyms. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Grantland finally allowed for the journalism and opinions of, basically, anyone else. When female contributors write features for Grantland, they are equalanother voice amidst other smart ideas. Women at Grantland are not cast aside to a separate, less-visited section of their website. That's precisely what happens at ESPN proper, the home of ESPNWa well-intentioned, largely ignored property at the bottom of ESPN.com, called upon only when ""women's issues"" affect sports. This is the kind of tokenism that affected FoxSports.com's Katie Nolan. In August, before the elevator footage of Ray Rice's domestic abuse incident was released, Nolan had the chance to ask Roger Goodell about why he didn't suspend Rice for more games, based on the first video. She didn't. ""I'm really going to hear about it from my bosses,"" she said. ""It's really not my role,"" she said. ""I played the role that had been assigned to me,"" she said. A month later, she understood this to be a part of a culture of quiet repression. ""Women in sports television are allowed to read headlines, patrol sidelines and generally facilitate conversation for their male colleagues,"" she said. ""Sometimes they even let us monitor the Internet from a couch."" She said all of this in a video on FoxSports.com. She ended it with, ""I'm ready when you are, Fox."" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Advertisement - Continue Reading Below She was not suspended. She was applauded on the company's website. And that is the problem with ESPN and the old-wave of sports media: Sports are not now being infiltrated by ""women's issues"" that demand one-off responses. Women are half the population of the worldand sports are a part of that world. There are 11 seats at the table at ESPN. All of them go to men. Women get their own table, but only sometimesand ESPN has placed that table where no one can hear them. ESPN personalitieseven those 11 menhave spent the last two weeks on television defending their position atop a moral high-ground. Each retired player and 60-year-old man has had his chance to spout tough talk about how he would never personally commit or condone domestic violence. Now that their company is standing behindas ESPN anchor Keith Olbermann put it""an enabler of men who beat women"" instead of an employee, where have these personalities gone? They are silent. Long-tenured editors and personalities of ESPN: Those condemnations mean nothing if you don't stand up for your ideals, your integrity, and the rights of women when your paycheck is on the line. It means you, too, are just like your bosses: When faced with reporting the truth or collecting a paycheckeven at the most critical moment of your journalistic careeryou will take the paycheck. It means every word spoken about morality from now on is simply just posturing to protect your public image. It means you are not a journalist. It means you are a commentator, for now and forever. So stand up. You'd stand for the defining issues of the moment: Corporate entanglement, equal rights, the idea of journalism, and your own integrity. You would be vindicated in the eyes of history during this very tiresome moment. You would be standing for the truth.",On ESPN and Domestic Violence,2014-09-26,Ben Collins

But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when. And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two? Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City. And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed. But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldnt be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous, so that posturing has fallen by the wayside. A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and Californias big three is all but assured, the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural? With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing. At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink, but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city. And Bettman hasnt been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot. Its been 15 years since the NHL expanded  and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west, taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense, the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced. And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting, at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota. Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion, this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork: Theres a lot of interest. Were hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City, Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games. We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. Its not something weve seriously considered yet. Like hell it isnt. Theyd have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously. And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear  one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area, it is going to stay through thick, thin and the almost impossible, as seems to be the case in Phoenix. But could that long-standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation? True theres a lease until 2028, but with the Panthers bleeding money, even the city of Sunrise cant seem to see the point of carrying on much longer, so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all. And while Kansas City isnt really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless theyre going to stretch it to four teams, saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U.S. cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen. Going back to Minnesota has been a success, and theres no question theres more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity. There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent, of course, but even if its true, after such a long wait this trivial detail  which only troubles the fans  isnt going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this. And any time the league decides it could use talent, they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game thats paying their salaries. Expansion will be happening, and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved. _EMAIL_ twitter.com/tg_gman",Gallagher: Bettman has changed his tune on NHL expansion,,Tony Gallagher

The article opens with some nostalgia about the original McPizza, its cornmeal crust and ""the stringy cheese, with a slightly sweeter-than normal marinara underneath ...""

And the stringy cheese, with a slightly sweeter-than normal marinara underneath? Maybe you shoved french fries in it like birthday candles. Or ate it crust first, as was the style at the time. In any case, if youre a child of the nineties, you remember it well: McDonalds pizza. And, like pogs and Beanie Babies, it too disappeared with the innocence of your childhood. Except, in two magical locations in Ohio and West Virginia, where one hero owner has kept the McDonalds pizza ovens burning all these years later. So bust out a gel pen to jot down these directions, because Im about to tell you where you can still buy McDonalds pizza. Neslted on the banks of the Ohio River, along the border with West Virginia sits the village of Pomeroy, population 1,852 in the 2010 census. And its McDonalds, located along Main Street on the riverbank, still pumps out pizza  in five minutes or less, of course. Its just a seven-and-a-half hour drive from Toronto in zero traffic, according to Google Maps. And, thanks to owner Greg Mills, theres another McDs where you can still get a slice, just over ninety kilometres away, across the state border. Spencer, West Virginia also boasts a McDonalds thats still lighting the pizza fires  or electrical coils, as the case may be. According to employee Judy Norman, its the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and its presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. She said the location sold 13 pizzas yesterday, but there are days when everyone wants pizza and there are days where just every so often you get a pizza [order]. Mills, who its pretty safe to call an American hero for preserving this very unique pizza, couldnt not be immediately reached for comment, but this post will be updated should he return our calls. Whatever actually happened to McDonalds pizza, you ask? Well, for starters, it turned out adult palates didnt quite take to it the same way kids did. When McDonalds first launched its pizza in the Canadian market in the early 90s, it was tapping into a growing appetite for pizza as burger sales dwindled. It even launched hockey-themed TV ads. The market for the savoury pie topped $2 billion in the early 90s, according to a 2004 National Post article on the death of McDonalds pizza. And the company poured $25 million into the ovens alone across Canada, to moderate success throughout the decade. Then the-drive through took over  remember waiting for your pizza to be delivered with a plastic number on top of your car?  and pizza slowed things down as its own sales were dragging. So the ovens were scrapped and McDonalds turned its sights on other gimmicky productions  like the Arch Deluxe, which I think we can blame for Jessica Biel becoming a thing. The saddest clarification of all time: As first reported by Metro Montreal and translated by Emergent, it appears theres some confusion as to whether the pizza being sold at these two locations is the McPizza we all remember. Unfortunately, McDonalds headquarters says its not the exact recipe, but its also reviewed online as being very close. So, the only way to sure is a road trip followed by a taste test.

Click here to read a follow-up post.] Ive been hearing since before Christmas about Project Chrome, the code name for what has been touted to me as the biggest reorganization in IBM history. Well, Project Chrome is finally upon us, triggered I suppose by this weeks announcement of an 11th consecutive quarter of declining revenue for IBM. Project Chrome is bad news, not good. Customers and employees alike should expect the worst. To fix its business problems and speed up its transformation,"" next week about 26 percent of IBM's employees will be getting phone calls from their managers. A few hours later a package will appear on their doorsteps with all the paperwork. Project Chrome will hit many of the worldwide services operations. The USA will be hit hard, but so will other locations. IBM's contractors can expect regular furloughs in 2015. One in four IBMers reading this column will probably start looking for a new job next week. Those employees will all be gone by the end of February. In the USA mainframe and storage talent will see deep cuts. This is a bit short-sighted and typical for IBM. They just announced the new Z13 mainframe and hope it will stimulate sales. Yet they will be cutting the very teams needed to help move customers from their old systems to the new Z13. The storage cuts are likely to be short-sighted, too. Most cloud services use different storage technology than customers use in their data centers. This makes data replication and synchronization difficult. IBM's cloud business needs to find a way to efficiently work well with storage systems found in customer data centers. Whacking the storage teams won't help with this problem. Project Chrome appears to be a pure accounting resource action  driven by the executive suite and designed to make IBM's financials look better for the next few quarters. Global Technology Services, the outsourcing part of IBM, is continuing to lose customers. That rate of loss  one Lufthansa-size customer every six weeks  seems to be holding. The size of Project Chrome cuts suggest IBM is trying to get three or four quarters ahead of the expected business losses. At this point IBM's business losses have become a self-fulfilling process with deep cuts followed by increasingly bad service, increasingly madder customers, and more lost business. When reached, IBM sent the following response: ""We do not comment on rumors, even ridiculous or baseless ones. If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing. This equates to several thousand people, a mere fraction of what's been reported. Last year, IBM hired 45,000 people, and the company currently has about 15,000 job openings around the world for new skills in growth areas such as cloud, analytics, security, and social and mobile technologies. This is evidence that IBM continues to remix its skills to match where we see the best opportunities in the marketplace."" The biggest reorganization in IBM's history will not really begin until the Project Chrome resource actions are done. People let go will be excluded from consideration for the new business units. In a few months those new business units will start to work calling on IBM customers to sell them on the new CAMSS (Cloud, Analytics, Mobile, Social and Security) stuff. They will walk into a hornet's nest. Some reorganizations are well thought-out and absolutely essential but Project Chrome wont be one of those. It will traumatize the corporation and put most accounts into immediate crisis. While survivors dig out from the devastation IBM will change their managers and their job descriptions. With fewer people and changing roles, things IBM has contractual obligations to do for its customers will start to be overlooked. If you are an IBM customer you should probably should start working on plans to keep your projects moving forward and your systems running. If you are an investor or Wall Street analyst its time to take a closer look at IBMs messaging. Stop believing everything you hear from IBM. Big Blue is a master at controlling the discussion. They state or announce something, treating it as fact whether it exists or not. They build a story around it. IBM uses this approach to control competitors, to manage customer expectations, and to conduct business on IBM's terms.",Next Week's Bloodbath At IBM Won't Fix The Real Problem,2015-01-22,Robert X.

""Late last year, a rumor began circulating at Stuyvesant that a junior named Mohammed Islam had made a fortune in the stock market. Not a small fortune, either. Seventy-two million,"" it reported. The reporter later said she saw a bank account of his with a ""seven figure"" balance.",http://nymag.com/news/articles/reasonstoloveny/2014/mohammed-islam-stock-trading/,No Error,"Editor's Note: In the most recent edition of New York, its annual Reasons to Love New York issue, the magazine published this story about a Stuyvesant High School senior named Mohammed Islam, who was rumored to have made $72 million trading stocks. Islam said his net worth was in the ""high eight figures."" As part of the research process, the magazine sent a fact-checker to Stuyvesant, where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight-figure bank account. After the story's publication, people questioned the $72 million figure in the headline, which was written by editors based on the rumored figure. The headline was amended. But in an interview with the New York Observer last night, Islam now says his entire story was made up. A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified. We were duped. Our fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better. New York apologizes to our readers. Rumors, on Wall Street, can be powerful. A whisper can turn into a current that moves markets, driving a stock price up or sending it tumbling. There may be only one other place where gossip holds such sway, and that is high school. Late last year, a rumor began circulating at Stuyvesant that a junior named Mohammed Islam had made a fortune in the stock market. Not a small fortune, either. Seventy-two million. An unbelievable amount of money for anyone, not least a high-school student, but as far as rumors go, this one seemed legit. Everyone at Stuy knew that Mohammed, the soft-spoken son of Bengali immigrants from Queens and the president of the schools Investment Club, was basically a genius. As the news spread, Mos stock went up. The school paper profiled him, Business Insider included him on a list of 20 Under 20, and Mo became a celebrity, as his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov put it on a recent Friday night at Mari Vanna near Union Square. A VIP! Mo, a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux-hawk, smiled shyly. Hes quiet today, said Patrick Trablusi, who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses. Humble. And tired: This is our third meeting of the day, Damir said, signaling to the waitress for another round. We saw a real-estate agent, a lawyer, you  Next were going to see a hedge-fund guy, Patrick said. The friends locked eyes and started to giggle. He basically wants to give us $150 million, Mo explained, a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks. The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks. Freshly squeezed apple juice, Damir said, passing them around. Its very good. Do you like caviar? After Mo became a celebrity, things got a little awkward at school. (Arent you the kid who made all that money? a teacher asked him.) So he reconnected with kids from his old school, Allen-Stevenson. One of them introduced him to Patrick, an aspiring financier, who introduced him to Damir at a poker game attended by kids whose parents are, according to Damir, the one percent of the one percent. The son of a Kazakh oligarch, Damir is tall, slim, and cocky, like a cigarette wearing a fedora. I call the poker game Destiny,'""he said. The waitress arrived with a plate. Here, have some caviar. Over late nights out and dinners at Morimoto, the three hatched a plan to start a hedge fund. There are a lot of steps we have to follow through, said Patrick, calling to mind a more serious Chuck Bass. But were on the right track. They plan to launch in June, after Mo turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license. Mos our maestro, Patrick said. Hes going to be earning the big bucks. Were just going to try to fill his needs. All three plan to attend college next year, but theyre not concerned about classes getting in the way of their goal: A billion dollars! Damir said. By next year! Mo affirmed the number with a nod. But its not just about money, he added. We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers  Like in Wolf of Wall Street! Damir interjected. And Mo is Jordan Belfort. No, but, not like that, Patrick said, blanching slightly. Like Belfort, Mo started with penny stocks. A cousin showed him how to trade. He loved the feeling of riskthe way his hand shook making the tradebut he swore it off after losing a chunk of the money hed made tutoring. I didnt have the balls for it, he said. He was 9. It was a while before he was ready to try again. In the meantime, he became a scholar of modern finance, studying up on hedge-fund managers. He was particularly enamored of Paul Tudor Jones. I had been paralyzed by my loss, Mo said. But he was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over. Paul Tudor Jones says, You learn more from your losses than from your gains.  Mo got into trading oil and gold, and his bank account grew. Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the high eight figures. More than enough to rent an apartment in Manhattanthough his parents wont let him live in it until he turns 18and acquire a BMW, which he cant drive because he doesnt yet have a license. Thus, it falls to his father to drive him past Tudor Joness Greenwich house for inspiration. Its because he is who he is that made me who I am today, Mo said. Which is to say: a believer in Wall Street. A lot of young people do start-ups, but I think its a bubble. Trading and investments will always be there. Money will always be rotating Money never sleeps! Damir added. Thats from the Wall Street movie. It all comes down to this, Mo continued. What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses dont keep going, theres no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs. The check arrived for the caviar and apple juice. It totaled $400. New York, thats where the moneys at, Damir shouted, pulling out a credit card. This reminded me of an old joke about robbing banks because thats where the money is. Damir grinned. My father has a quote, he said. Its really dope: You can rob a bank with a gun, but you can rob the whole world with a bank.  Patrick buried his face in his hands.

They are five feet tall and weigh 300 pounds.,Microsoft&Robots,Jul 3,"The story originated on Nov. 17, when news articles began appearing at sites such as Extreme Tech. Its article reported that, ""Showing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization, Microsoft has become one of the first companies to deploy autonomous robot security guards."" There were also pictures showing the robots in action.",http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/194338-here-come-the-autonomous-robot-security-guards-what-could-possibly-go-wrong,No Error,"Showing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization, Microsoft has become one of the first companies to deploy autonomous robot security guards. Dubbed the K5, Microsofts Silicon Valley campus was being policed last week by five of these roughly human-sized 300-pound (136 kg) robots, each equipped with enough cameras, sensors, artificial intelligence, and alarms that they can replace most human security patrols. Fortunately, despite looking like uncomfortably like a Dalek from the Doctor Who universe, the K5 is not (yet) equipped with a ray gun or any other method for harming or detaining humans. Updated: Microsoft contacted ExtremeTech to tell us that the robots were only temporarily deployed at its Silicon Valley campus, as part of a demonstration put on by Knightscope. Microsoft PR says it isnt aware of any future plans to deploy such robots. The K5, built by the Californian company Knightscope, is billed rather euphemistically as an autonomous data machine that provides a commanding but friendly physical presence. Basically, its a security guard on wheels. Inside that rather large casing (its 5 foot tall!) there are four high-def cameras facing in each direction, another camera that can do car license plate recognition, four microphones, gentle alarms, blaring sirens, weather sensors, and WiFi connectivity so that each robot can contact HQ if theres some kind of security breach/situation. For navigating the environment, theres GPS and laser scanning (LIDAR I guess). And of course, at the heart of each K5 is a computer running artificial intelligence software that integrates all of that data and tries to make intelligent inferences  like, should I tell HQ about that large gathering of teenagers, or should that man be climbing in through that window? If a K5 decides that theres a situation, it can use one of its built-in sirens to try and diffuse things  or it can message HQ to summon a human. If you step in front of the K5, or otherwise interfere with it, it will gently warn you with some chimes  but if you dont move, an ear-piercing alarm is triggered. Other than its sirens and its rather imposing design, the K5 isnt equipped with any weapons or other tools for resolving situations. (Does anyone else think it looks like the lovechild of a Dalek and EVE from WALL-E?) K5 isnt just for catching criminals, either: If you find yourself in trouble/danger, theres also a button on the top of the robot that summons help from HQ. Read: Microsoft wants to be part of Judgment Day, too The purpose of the K5, like most robots, is straightforward: To replace expensive human workers. The K5 can run for around 24 hours on a single battery charge, automatically navigates back to the charging point when its running low, and only takes 15-20 minutes to recharge. Obviously, in the long run, this is cheaper and more efficient than a human security guard  plus, as technology improves, the K5 will probably be more vigilant and capable of spotting smaller discrepancies than a human. In theory, because of the lower cost, you could also field lots of K5 robots, reducing the number of potential holes in security coverage. It goes without saying, though, that deploying a fleet of roughly human-sized, autonomous robots is just a little bit scary. At the very least, a 300-pound robot would cause a lot of damage if it ran into something  a car, a shop window, a child. In all likelihood, though, if these robotic security guards are popular, theyll eventually be equipped with weapons  perhaps a taser for subduing a suspect, and a tear gas launcher for clearing groups of people. At that point, you need to be really sure that the AI is free of bugs.

It also quoted Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter talking about it in a hypothetical scenario. (The Wall Street Journal made a similar claim in March 2014, but Amazon denied it.""",http://nypost.com/2014/11/21/amazon-plans-a-streaming-video-alternative/,No Error,"Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is primed and ready for a fresh assault on the streaming-video space. The e-commerce giant will roll out a new ad-supported streaming offering early next year that will be separate from its $99-a-year Prime membership, which includes a video service, sources said. The ad-supported option  part of an overhaul of its media offerings  poses a serious challenge to streaming rivals such as Hulu and Netflix, analysts said. If they do an ad-supported service, they will decouple it from Prime and that is a Netflix killer, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. It wont be $99 a year. Pachter suggested Amazon would undercut Netflixs current monthly price of $7.99. Who wouldnt switch if you were poor or youre a cord-cutter? he added. Although it will be separate from Prime, the ad-supported service is ultimately a bid by Amazon to lure people to eventually pay up for Prime membership, said one ad source familiar with Amazons plans. The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesnt want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share, the source said. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon was weighing such a move, but sources confirmed that its a definite go. Amazon is prepping a new attack at a time when its video service is gaining ground, sources said. Amazon doesnt disclose the number of Prime members, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates it has 50 million global customers. While Primes big draw has been two-day shipping, about half of Prime subscribers use the video service that is included with it, or around 25 million, sources said. By comparison, Netflix has 33 million domestic subscribers. A recent Sandvine study also shows that Amazon is making major strides  but has a long way to go before catching Netflix. Amazons broadband traffic on fixed networks grew from 1.61 percent to 2.58 percent, the study showed. One change is that Amazon snagged popular HBO content, including The Wire, True Blood and Boardwalk Empire. Netflix accounts for 32.39 percent of aggregate traffic. Rumors have been rampant that Amazon plans to let advertisers into its media ecosystem. Amazon has already experimented with ads in some shows, according to tech site Re/code. For advertisers, the service could be the Holy Grail in terms of targeting. In theory, Amazon could tell if ads viewed online led to purchases on its retail site. The news that Nielsen will start rating shows on subscription video services starting with Netflix is likely to encourage advertisers who want to make the leap without forcing Amazon to give up its own data. Amazon will also have leverage over content producers when it comes to the way it chooses to promote shows and movies within its growing ecosystem, a Hollywood source said.

http://www.emergent.info/comcast-fired,Business%252FTech,Unverified,Claim: Comcast got a man fired from his job after he complained about the company's service,A California man says that Comcast got him fired from his job at PriceWaterhouseCoopers after he complained about poor service and incorrect charges.,,Jul 3,It was first reported by Consumerist on Oct. 6 in a report that identified the man by his first name. A follow up from Ars Technica on Oct. 7 named him as Conal O'Rourke.,http://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/,No Error,"UPDATE #3: Conal has filed a lawsuit against the cable giant in a federal court in California, alleging that  among other claims  Comcast violated a federal law prohibiting cable companies from sharing customers information without their consent.  UPDATE #2: Comcast has apologized for the horrible service and billing that Conal experienced during his year-plus as a customer, but says that nobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired.  UPDATE: Conals former employers have given a brief explanation of his dismissal, without providing any details as to what exactly he said to Comcast that merited terminating his employment. - When you complain to your cable company, you certainly dont expect that the cable company will then contact your employer and discuss your complaint. But thats exactly what happened to one former Comcast customer who says he was fired after the cable company called a partner at his accounting firm. TL;DR Version  Customer spends 11 months being overcharged by Comcast. Customers complaints go unresolved.  Customer contacts office of Comcasts Controller to complain about billing practices.  Comcast contacts customers employer, which happens to do a lot of business with Comcast, says customer used employers name during complaint.  Customer insists he did not use company name; fired by employer anyway.  Comcast will not release e-mails or audio recordings to counter customers claim that he didnt use the name of his employer. IT BEGAN INNOCENTLY ENOUGH Conal began subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013 after he says he was sold a 9-month promotional pricing offer. But from the start, there were issues with his service, as he was being charged for set-top boxes that had yet to be activated. Additionally, someone at Comcast billing had misspelled Conals last name, meaning some of his bills were not being delivered. He says he met with a Comcast rep in May 2013 about the billing issues and promised they would all be sorted out, but things only got worse. A few months later, the promotional discount shrunk and Conals monthly bill increased by $20, in addition to still being charged for unactivated devices in his house. Comcast also twice charged him an additional $7 for a second modem he did not have. Meanwhile, attempts to get a resolution from Comcast went unanswered. CUTTING THE CORD He attempted to cancel his service in Oct. 2013 but says a Comcast rep convinced him that the billing issues would be resolved and that he would get free DVR service and The Movie Channel for three months as compensation. But things didnt just continue as they had before; Comcast somehow managed to sink even lower than it had before, sending Conal about a dozen pieces of equipment that he didnt order. There were a few DVRs, modem, standard boxes and equipment that I was unfamiliar with, he says. Making matters worse, Comcast billed him $1,820 for all this stuff hed never requested and had no use for. When Conal returned all the equipment to Comcast and, being an experienced accountant at one of the nations most prestigious firms, even prepared a spreadsheet detailing every charge, overcharge, payment and credit on his account for his brief time as a Comcast customer. He says even this didnt convince Comcast that there was a problem and that Conal had been overcharged. And even though it wasnt yet past due, Comcast sent Conals account into collections in Feb. 2014. THE CALL IN QUESTION And so on Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcasts customer service, which hadnt been of any help in the year hed been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the companys Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues. He describes that callback as bizarre, with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with How can I help you? Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldnt specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house. So he tried the Controllers office again, to let them know that the rep theyd sent his way had failed miserably at her job. During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcasts billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation. This ultimately led to two service calls where no one ever showed up and no explanations were given. But something did happen. Just not anything good. WE KNOW WHERE YOU WORK Remember how we briefly mentioned above that Conal worked for a large, prestigious accounting firm? Comcast certainly noticed that fact, especially since that firm is one that does business with Comcast. At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conals subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says hed only received positive feedback and reviews for his work. Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controllers office looked him up online and figured out where he worked. When he was fired, Conals employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees. But Conal has never seen this e-mail in order to say whether its accurate and Comcast has thus far refused to release any tapes of the phone calls related to this matter. And while his former employer did provide consulting services to Comcast, it was not the accounting firm that audited Comcasts books. So Conal doesnt quite see how mentioning the name of his employer would have helped gain him any leverage. In response to a letter from Conals lawyer  he has not filed a lawsuit, but its not out of the question  Comcasts Senior Deputy General Counsel admits that the company did contact Conals employer but says that Conal is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn about his dispute with Comcast. THE HEART OF THE MATTER I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controllers office. Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened. And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldnt have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service hed paid for. Im also curious why, even though Comcast insists that Conal attempted to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolved, it has not specifically cited language that he allegedly used in the call. How many times a day do Comcast reps hear a customer say something like Im a lawyer or Im a big shot at [fill in the blank]? How many of those result in Comcast going out of its way to contact that customers employer? We reached out to Comcast to ask whether its company policy to contact customers employers. No one answered that question, but a rep for Comcast did give a brief statement. Our customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us, reads the statement. Comcast says it has previously apologized to Conal, but adds we will review his lawyers letter and respond as quickly as possible.","Unhappy Customer: Comcast Told My Employer About Complaint, Got Me Fired",2014-10-06,Chris Morran

For the past few months, a group inside the Post has been working on a new application that will offer a curated selection of news and photographs from the daily newspaper in a magazine-style, tablet-friendly format. The application will come preinstalled on Amazons newly updated Kindle Fire tablet, expected to be launched later this fall with the larger 8.9-inch screen, according to people with knowledge of the Posts plans. The app will be free for owners of the larger Kindle, at least at first. It will eventually be available for download on other Kindles as well as to owners of Apples iPad and various Android devices, and it will carry a monthly subscription fee. A Post spokesperson declined to comment. Inside the Post, the effort has been dubbed Project Rainbow and is being led by Kerry Lauerman, the former editor-in-chief of Salon.com. Lauerman joined the paper as a senior editor in July to work on an initiative focused on the fast-growing mobile readership, according to a Post press release announcing the hire. Lauerman reports to Cory Haik, the Posts executive producer for digital news. One person with knowledge of Project Rainbow called it an experiment and part of a larger effort to find ways to expand the Posts reach. Its the first sign that Bezos will create ties between the newspaper and the e-commerce giant he started 20 years ago. Since Bezos bought the paper last year, media observers have wondered how he will resuscitate a franchise with plenty of old-media challenges, such as declining print advertising and a readership that increasingly gets its news online and from mobile devices. The paper introduced a novel program that allows smaller publications to give their paying readers online access to the Posts website. In September, meanwhile, Bezos dismissed the Posts longtime publisher, Katharine Weymouth, and replaced her with Frederick J. Ryan Jr., a former aide to President Ronald Reagan. Bezos has also accelerated hiring at the newspaper, bringing in 100 new journalists while cutting pensions and other retirement benefits for current employees. The resulting buzz has been positive, on balance. David Carr, media columnist at the New York Times, just heralded a recent turnaround in quality: The once-embattled newspaper, he wrote, is in the middle of a great run, turning out the kind of reporting that journalistsand readerslive for. Amazons Kindle Fire tablets and its new Fire Phone lag in popularity behind competing tablets and phones from Apple, Samsung Electronics, and others. But Amazon has placed a unique bet that editorially produced content, such as Amazon-published books, Amazon-produced TV shows, and now perhaps Washington Post-published news, can attract additional users.",Jeff Bezos's New Plan for News: The Washington Post Becomes an Amazon Product,2014-10-06,Brad Stone

I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox.

According to multiple posters on the MacRumors forums , using the ""Reset All Settings"" option under General --> Reset has caused documents to be permanently deleted from iCloud Drive.The ""Reset All Settings"" option explicitly says that ""No data or media will be deleted,"" and it is meant to reset all user preferences to the default out-of-the-box settings.

http://www.emergent.info/beats-shutdown,Business%252FTech,Unverified,Claim: Apple will shutdown Beats Music,"Following its acquisition of Beats, Apple is reportedly going to shutdown the Beats streaming music service.",,Jul 3,"TechCrunch reported it, citing ""several prominent employees at Apple and Beats.""",http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-plans-to-shut-down-beats-music/,No Error,"Apple will discontinue the streaming music service Beats Music it acquired in May, according to five sources, including several prominent employees at Apple and Beats. Many engineers from Beats Music have already been moved off the product and onto other projects at Apple, including iTunes. Its not clear when exactly Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dres music service will be shut down or what Apple will do with streaming, but every source with knowledge of the situation that we talked to agreed Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music brand. [Update: Apple has told TechCrunch that our report of Beats being shut down is not true, but sources familiar with the situation tell Re/code that Apple may, however, modify [Beats Music] over time, and one of those changes could involved changing the Beats Music brand. This aligns with what my sources said, which is that the Beats Music brand will be shut down, but that its unclear what Apple wants to do in streaming music. It seems quite possible that the Beats Music product could be rolled into iTunes rather than being shuttered, but thats semantics. Apples response really depends on the interpretation of shut down. If Apple rolls Beats Music into iTunes and removes the dedicated Beats Music app from the App Store, I would call that being shut down. Beats Music itself came from a rebranding aka shutdown of the MOG music streaming service it acquired. Well see what happens if and when Apple adds streaming to iTunes, but its doubtful that Apple will maintain Beats Music as its own brand and independent product.] The fact that the new iPhones did not come pre-installed with Beats Music, while several other Apple apps came loaded on the 6 and 6 Plus, should have been a red flag. There was also nothing said about Beats Music during the Apple Watch reveal, even though the services radio and fire-and-forget playlists could work well on a wearable. In August, Beats Music was being advertised to new users on iOS 7, yet the only time Beats Music got an off-hand mention at the September launch event was when Apple CEO Tim Cook said the new U2 album would be available there. Instead of Beats Music, the Apple Watch features a unannounced music app [Update: Remote app] with a blue play button (top right in the photo below) that instantly started playing songs when tapped during a demo. Considering Apples penchant for simple, unified brands, and how it despises fragmentation, shutting down Beats Music makes a lot of sense. Running a second music service in parallel with iTunes that forces people to learn a whole new interface might have confused customers. Beats Musics CEO Ian Rogers was also put in charge of iTunes Radio, meaning hes already splitting his time rather than just focusing on Beats Music. Shutting down Beats Music also meshes with reports that the Beats acquisition was mostly about getting Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dres talent on board, and picking up the headphone business, not about streaming music. Having Beats as a side brand in music accessories flows naturally, but seems clumsy when it comes to software. Weve contacted Apple with a request for comment on its plans for Beat Music. [Update: Response in update above.] Beats has recently launched an Apple TV channel and released a Listen Now integration with Shazam, but both seem like they could have been in the pipeline directly. One Beats Music employee told me some teams on the non-technical side have been told to keep up business as usual. The move will let Apple focus on its flagship music product with its enormous 800 million user base and treasure trove of over 400 million stored credit cards. Beats Musics growth has likely been hampered by its late start compared to competitors like Spotify, Rdio, Google Music, and Pandora. Though its strategy was to differentiate itself through curated playlists and mood-based radio, those failed to capture the attention of mainstream listeners. Thanks to seven-day free trials and multi-month demos through AT&T, 5 million people had tried Beats by May, but only 250,000 had signed up for a paid subscription. Thats pretty small compared to the 10 million paid subscribers and 40 million total listeners on Spotify, and 76.4 million active listeners on Pandora. Yet stacked up against the iTunes userbase, Beats Music is just a drop in the bucket for Apple. Apple certainly didnt hesitate to shut down music streaming service Lala after acquiring it. The big question is what will Apple do with streaming music. Buying Beats Music may still assist Apple hear through talent, technology, and industry relationships even without the Beats Music brand. One source said Apple may roll streaming into iTunes. This could be the most logical strategy for Apple if it can find a way to keep its traditional music file download customers happy while opening its catalogue to streaming for early adopters who want to listen from the cloud. Perhaps rather than just buy buttons, there could be play buttons in iTunes, too. Another source said Apple plans to make some significant music announcement in the first half of next year. Apple is in the tricky position of trying to smoothly transition its music business from the download to the streaming era. Digital music sales fell 13.3 percent in 2013, while U.S. streaming grew 32 percent. With streaming eating downloads, Apple will have to make a shift or at least accomodate streaming. But it doesnt just want to ditch sales overnight. 1.26 billion songs and 117.6 million albums were sold online in 2013, providing vital capital to the music industry. Forcing users across the chasm from iTunes to Beats Music seems precarious, especially with on-demand streaming competitors like Spotify and Google Music looking to pounce on potential customers. Its doubtful that Apple would abandon its iTunes brand after 13 years of success just because Beats joined the family. Evolving a unified Apple music service sounds a lot better than having two playing out of sync.

A Comcast agent named Jeremy allegedly called Tor an illegal service. The Comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies. The Comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the Tor browser. The customer refused to answer. The next day the customer called Comcast and spoke to another agent named Kelly who reiterated that Comcast does not want its customers using Tor. The Comcast agent then allegedly told the customer: Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that arent so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day. How did Comcast know its customers were using Tor in the first place? Because Tor Browser provides online anonymity to its users, This would mean that Comcast is monitoring the online activities of its users, to (among other things) check if they are following their Acceptable Use Policy. Comcast has previously been listed by the Tor project as a Bad ISP. The users of the Tor project listed Comcast as a bad ISP that is not friendly to Tor. The Tor project cited Comcasts Acceptable Use Policy for its residential customers which claims to not allow servers or proxies under technical restrictions.: use or run dedicated, stand-alone equipment or servers from the Premises that provide network content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises local area network (PremisesLAN), also commonly referred to as public services or servers. Examples of prohibited equipment and servers include, but are not limited to, email, web hosting, file sharing, and proxy services and servers; A Comcast spokesperson told DeepDotWeb that: We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customers account with a valid court order. And if were asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away. However, this statement appears to be at odds with Comcasts treatment of Ross Ulbricht, alleged Dread Pirate Roberts. Comcast previously corroborated with the FBI by providing information on alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbrichts internet usage. Ulbrichts legal defense without a warrant. Ulbricht was most certainly never given a warning by Comcast or given time to contact a lawyer before he was arrested in a San Francisco library last October. Comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws. Under the Six Strikes plan, Comcast customers who are caught by Comcast pirating copy-written material are emailed by Comcast and told to cease the activity.

http://www.emergent.info/apple-path,Business%252FTech,Unverified,Claim: Apple is buying Path,Apple will acquire social networking app Path.,,Jul 3,"A report by PandoDaily, which cites ""a single well-placed source inside Apple’s engineering team.""",http://pando.com/2014/09/09/source-apple-set-to-acquire-path-in-an-attempt-to-bolster-ios-social-cred/,No Error,"In a day packed with major Apple announcements, the company tackled smartphones, wearables, and payments. But there is one more sector that may be about to get the Apple treatment: Social. According to a single well-placed source inside Apples engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morins Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, Its almost done, if not signed already, but its essentially a done deal. If true, it would be major news for the heretofore struggling social platform that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers  particularly in non-Asian markets. Apple hasnt fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color. According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apples newly refreshed Messages app. That doesnt mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebooks $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google. Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year, and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms, it would be lucky to command anywhere near Instagram/Whatsapp sums. According to App Annie, Path ranks just 177th among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year, the company reportedly commanded a sub-$400 million valuation, well below the $500 million-plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on, exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell, for many Valley observers, that would be the win of the century for Path investors, many of which have all but left the company for dead. Apples re-entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp), Twitter, and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals, its unclear just where an Apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion, all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google+ as a standalone social platform, and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Apples one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage, which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product, abandoning its long-held love of more lasting, intimate communications. Its certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apple's messaging platform, but its unclear, beyond the design prowess, how this acquisition helps Apple, at any price. Adding additional fuel to this fire, Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for todays Apple keynote event, a high profile position reserved for Dr. Dre and other key Apple insiders. Did not forget about Dre. pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYr  Dave Morin (@davemorin) September 9, 2014 Apple has been known to be a fan of Morins, as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the companys decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense, it wouldnt be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. Jason Calacanis made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today, noting Morins seating at todays event and Apples long-standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking whether such an acquisition makes sense for years. To be clear, even if our source is correct, these transactions are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and (at least in the case of a public company like Apple) a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. It's certainly an unexpected outcome, but it would sound even more crazy if Apple didnt have north of $150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morin's vaunted reputation for design, and Apple's social struggles I can't think of a better home for the once-hyped app. Dont be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also-ran status.

The site attributed the information to ""Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer."" To be clear, this is not the first claim of a 12-inch MacBook. Reports surfaced in 2014 that the company would launch one with a Retina Display. However, this new claim is specific to the Air and to 2015.",http://9to5mac.com/2015/01/06/macbook-air-12-inch-redesign/,No Error,"Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apples first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012. iPad Air 2 The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides. Besides a new look for the front of the computer, the entire unibody has been revamped from the keyboard to the trackpad to the speakers. Taking cues from the 12-inch PowerBook introduced by Steve Jobs over a decade ago, the new keyboard sits edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop. In addition to going edge-to-edge, the entire key set has been subtly redesigned so that each key sits noticeably closer together. Apple has squeezed the keys closer in order for the computer to be as narrow as possible, which can be seen in the rendition below: Apple has also relocated some of the function keys across the top and simplified the arrow key array in order to keep the keyboard as narrow as possible without taking away from overall usability. In addition to the keyboard, the trackpad has been changed. The trackpad is approximately the same width as that on the 11-inch MacBook Air (if not ever-so-slightly wider), but it is apparently slightly taller, nearly touching the bottoms of the keyboard and the frame. In line with earlier rumors, it also appears that the new trackpad does not have the same clicking effect as found on current and earlier MacBook models. The elimination of physical feedback in the click is part of Apples plan to reduce the thickness of the MacBook to a bare minimum. As can be seen in 9to5Mac artist Michael Steebers rendition above, the new 12-inch Air (on the left) is far thinner than the current 11-inch model (on the right). Taking cues from the current Air, the future model has a teardrop-like, tapered design that gets thinner from top to bottom. Above the keyboard are four redesigned speaker grills that actually double as ventilation holes for the fan-less device to keep cool. The upcoming laptop is so thin that Apple employees are said to refer to the device as the MacBook Stealth internally. In order to reach that new level of portability, Apple not only slimmed down the trackpad and tweaked the speakers but the ports as well: The upcoming 12-inch Air has the fewest amount of ports ever on an Apple computer, as can be seen in the rendition above. On the right side is a standard headphone jack and dual-microphones for input and noise-canceling. On the left side is solely the new USB Type-C port. Yes, Apple is currently planning to ditch standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and even its Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards on this new notebook. We must note that Apple tests several designs of upcoming products, so Apple may choose to ultimately release a new Air that does include the legacy components, though there is very little space on the edges for them. As weve reported on multiple occasions, the new USB Type-C connector is smaller, faster, and more capable than the standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports on existing computers. The connector is able to replace the Thunderbolt Display port on the current Apple laptops as USB Type-C actually has the technology to drive displays. Additionally, the latest specifications from the USB foundation indicate that USB Type-C can actually be used to power computers, which makes the standard MagSafe plugs unnecessary on this new device. The connector is also reversible like Lightning on iPads and iPhones, which should make the overall experience a bit more intuitive. As the new MacBook may only have a single port, it would make sense for Apple to create a hub of some sort for users to be able to plug in multiple devices into the new laptop. Apple already ships all sorts of adapters for its Macs and iOS Devices, so adding yet another attachment to the accessory portfolio would not be unprecedented. With Apple moving to a new Space Gray color on its iOS devices and on some Macs (such as with the 2013 Mac Pro), it seems possible that this new MacBook may come in a new gray color, as shown off in some of our renditions. The latest rumors indicate that the new MacBook Air will ship in mid-2015 (perhaps around WWDC), while other reports have claimed that the new Air is already nearing production. With Intel revealing the latest news on the Broadwell chipset family at CES this week, the ball is likely now in Apples court for pushing the future of mobile computing into the world.",Apples next major Mac revealed: the radically new 12-inch MacBook Air,2015-01-06,Thunderbolt Display

It cites unnamed friends of Emwazi, who told the post that the voice in the video belongs to their former friend. The story also quotes Asim Qureshi, research director at the human rights group CAGE, as saying it's Emwazi. (He met with Emwazi before he left for Syria.) The claim remains Unverified because British and U.S. intelligence officials have refused to confirm or deny it, and as of now there is no conclusive evidence linking Emwazi to the videos. A New York Times report said that the ""story was confirmed by a senior British security official,"" but did not offer a name. CBS news also cited an unnamed official to say the name is correct.

(The Washington Post) The world knows him as Jihadi John, the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online. But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize. [View: The atrocities of the Islamic State] I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John, said one of Emwazis close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him. A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held. There was an extremely strong resemblance, Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said when shown one of the videos and asked to confirm whether Emwazi could be Jihadi John. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person, Qureshi added. Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John. James B. Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September  only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley  that officials believed they had succeeded. Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foleys killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded. [Read: The Islamic State is failing at being a state] In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm. A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues. ISIL is another name for the Islamic State. U.S. officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazis family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice. The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said. [Archives: The tactics of Islamic State beheadings] He was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich. The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalize after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster. Foreign policy reporter Adam Goldman explains who Mohammed Emwazi is and how The Washington Post discovered his identity. (Gillian Brockell and Alice Li/The Washington Post) Emwazi and two friends  a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib  never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. Its unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported. Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britains domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post. [Read: Reaction to an identity revealed] Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda. Emwazi attened the University of Westminster, where he studied computer programming. (Toby Melville/Reuters) The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam. Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated, Qureshi said. Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalize his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait. In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again  this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so. [Read: A Brooklyn mothers struggle to keep her son from Islamic State] I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started, he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait. Mohammed Emwazi, who grew up in west London, is believed to have lived in this house before he left for Syria. (Andy Rain/EPA) Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!! In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice. This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation, Qureshi said. In the end, he felt actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions. [Read: Key takeaways of Emwazis path to extremism] Close friends of Emwazis also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. Its unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how. One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone. He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere, one of the friends said. He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out. Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. Its unclear what he told them about his activities there. A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility the box. Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed George. A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages. [The Islamic State caliphate is in danger of losing its main supply route] Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. He was the most deliberate, a former hostage said. Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic States de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State. About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi. I was wondering if you could send me your number, he wrote. Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up. There was no response. Goldman reported from Washington.

Its story from Feb. 23 said that the accusation was made by Iraqi politician Hakim Al-Zamili and attributed his comments to a ""report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq."" (The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq is a political party.) There is no record of that, and the story went on to make the ludicrous claim that ""US-led coalition planes ... airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.""",http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13931204001534,No Error,"World Iraqi Army Downs 2 UK Planes Carrying Weapons for ISIL TEHRAN (FNA)- Iraq's army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday. ""The Iraqi Parliament's National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,"" Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard. The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas. The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end. Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists. ""We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL's control in Al-Baqdadi region,"" the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying. He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi. Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition's planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces. Al-Zameli underlined that the coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq. ""There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition's military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),"" he told FNA in January. He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter. ""The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations. He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, ""These documents are given to the investigation committee ... and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace."" Also in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq. ""The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,"" Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said. He said the coalition's support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, ""The coalition has not targeted ISIL's main positions in Iraq."" In late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province. MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported. He added that the US and the international coalition are ""not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month"". Gharawi added that ""the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces."" Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that ""unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city"". Also in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft. ""The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,"" Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA. ""The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,"" she added. Hababi said that the coalition's precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise. In late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad. Field sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad. In October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue. The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group - while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition's and the US' claims, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said. The US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria. The US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters. Video footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants. The Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL's deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue.",Farsnews,,

The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters. Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down. The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer. The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering. Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea. Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip. The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron. Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area. Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard. This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams. In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes. In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning.",Hundreds of Palestinians flee as Israel opens dams into Gaza Valley,,June

President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family. The adoption practice derives from an old custom by which the president adopts the seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between to prevent him from becoming a werewolf. Belief in the legend was once so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons. The custom became a law in the 1970s and provided the boys with presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday. Until 2009, the law only applied to Catholic boys. Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson. On Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentinas history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together. The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a magical moment with a marvelous family. She described Yair as a total sweety, and his mother a Queen Esther. She tweeted that the Tawils are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common. The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.

A photo posted to Twitter on Monday by the Ansar al-Deen Front, an Islamic extremist brigade seemingly comprised largely of Chechen fighters, shows the Ford F-250 with a militant standing in the bed firing the anti-aircraft gun. Speaking to CBS News Tuesday morning, a representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said the vehicle was sold to the AutoNation dealership in Houston in Oct. 2013, and that's the last they knew of it. The company has been besieged by phone calls -- including threats -- since the photo appeared online, clearly showing the company's name and phone number. CBS News is not identifying the company due to the nature of some of the attention it has received. They have employed an attorney and intend to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo from the Internet. Reached by CBS News Tuesday morning, a person identifying himself as a manager at AutoNation would not comment on the sale history of the vehicle in question, saying ""we can't give information like that over the phone,"" before hanging up the phone. The representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said they would ""most definitely"" be removing their logo from all vehicles sold in the future.

Titchmarsh, 65, asks in an ITV show to be screened on Christmas Day: Is it edible? Prof Crawley replies: That depends what you mean. Its eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick. The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness. Titchmarsh jokingly replies: I think Ill forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms. Then he adds: Not something to try at home. Later he told The Sun: That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are. I wont be eating any of that, though, no. My idea of hard drugs is Nurofen. On the programme, The Queens Garden, he explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools. He says: Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.

None of the sources were named.",http://www.buzzfeed.com/mikegiglio/isis-is-trying-to-sell-the-body-of-us-hostage-james-foley-fo,No Error,"ANTAKYA, Turkey  Middlemen with ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) have turned to a grim new method of trying to secure funds in recent days. With the group having failed to strike deals to ransom the U.S. hostages in its custody  instead beheading three of them since July  its intermediaries are now trying to negotiate the sale of the body of at least one of the men it killed. Three sources in contact with ISIS or its associates told BuzzFeed News that it wants to sell the remains of James Foley, the U.S. journalist whose August death was the first in a series of high-profile executions of Western hostages by ISIS hands. They said ISIS wants $1 million for Foley's body, which it would deliver across the border to Turkey, and that the group was willing to provide a DNA sample to facilitate a deal. If true, the attempted sale would highlight the ruthlessness behind the hostage-taking enterprise that has provided ISIS with deep reservoirs of funds and publicity  as well as the group's cold calculation as it works to raise more cash. At one point early this year, ISIS held 23 Western hostages in Syria. Fifteen Europeans were freed as governments reportedly paid millions of dollars in ransoms, but the British and American hostages remained. Both governments refuse to negotiate for hostages or to allow families to pay ransoms. In the months since Foley's death, ISIS has released videotaped executions of the U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, the British aid worker Alan Henning, and the U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. British journalist John Cantlie and a U.S. woman, a 26-year-old aid worker, remain in ISIS hands. All three of the sources seeking to act as middlemen in a deal with the secretive extremists have been granted anonymity to protect their safety. One, a former Syrian rebel fighter, has ties to ISIS commanders dating to the early stages of Syria's civil war. He said he has served as an intermediary in hostage negotiations with Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, and with ISIS. One day this fall, to prove his bona fides in the murky trade, he opened his iPhone to display unpublished videos of Western hostages in Nusra's custody. This former rebel said he was approached by an ISIS leader who asked him to find a channel to either the U.S. government or Foley's family. Like the other sources, he noted a price of $1 million and the promise of DNA. ""They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,"" he said. ""They will not give the DNA without the money."" He claimed his motivation was to help the grieving family find closure, calling his work ""a humanity case."" Another intermediary, a businessman who has sought to use his own ISIS connections to facilitate hostage deals in the past, was candid about his goals: ""This is business."" The trade in Western hostages has created a shadowy marketplace in which middlemen like these seek to negotiate deals in order to receive commission. They might inflate their connections on one side of proposed negotiations in order to draw interest from the other, so they can make a case for being included in the transaction. The idea of selling Foley's body has drawn attention among some of these middlemen of late, according to a Syrian who was involved with previous negotiations with ISIS over U.S. hostages. Both the former rebel fighter and the businessman said that one point person for the negotiations would be a senior official in the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the U.S.-backed rebel coalition, who was involved in previous ISIS talks over U.S. hostages as well as deals to free European ones. In an interview in Antakya, this FSA official expressed dismay that word of the attempted sale of Foley's remains had leaked. He urged this reporter not to publish an article on the subject, fearing that the attention could sabotage any potential deal. Of particular concern, he said, was that the U.S. government might seek to put a stop to it. Having allowed the U.S. hostages to die in ISIS custody, he reasoned, it would look bad if such a deal succeeded now. Foley's parents have said that the U.S. government threatened them with prosecution if they paid a ransom for their son's release. ""It will be like a shame for the U.S. government,"" the FSA official said. ""People will ask why you brought the body but you didn't bring him when he was alive."" The FSA official described himself as the ""manager"" of the proposed negotiations. He was in touch with a middleman representing ISIS, he said, and if a deal progressed would seek to arrange it with someone representing the Foley family. As before, ISIS seemed intent on making money from its hostage enterprise by any means. ""They were trying to negotiate (a ransom deal) for his freedom before they beheaded him, and after beheading him, they are trying to sell his body,"" the FSA official said. The Foley family had no comment for this article. An official with the U.S. State Department said ""we are seeking more information"" on whether ISIS is trying to sell the remains of U.S. hostages. A senior U.S. diplomat called the idea ""disgusting.""

An internal state document obtained by South Koreas KBS TV station contains an administrative order from then leader Kim Jong-il for all party, army and police officials to ensure the directive was carried out. The order was issued in January 2011, shortly after Kim Jong-un had been anointed as his fathers successor. Kim Jong-il died in December of the same year. All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-un  and train them to voluntarily change their names, said the document, extracts of which were aired by KBS on Tuesday. The process involved revising names on official documents, including social security cards and school diplomas. Officials were also directed to reject birth certificates for any newborns named Kim Jong-un. Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip  regarding this project, it added. The authenticity of the official directive could not be independently verified, and Seouls unification ministry declined to comment on whether it was genuine. But one government official noted that the Pyongyang regime was known to have banned citizens sharing the names of founding president Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il. Given the North maintained the policy under the two previous leaders, there is a possibility that it would continue to do so now, the official said. The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea for more than six decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult. Park Jin-hee, a North Korean defector working for KBS who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive had been effectively enforced. There is no one in the North named Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-un, Park, who defected in 2008, said.",North Korea directive reveals apparent ban on sharing Kim Jong-uns name,2014-12-03,Agence France-Presse In Seoul

Update Dec. 5: Lebanon says DNA tests prove that she is an ex-wife and one of her children is his.

The arrest reportedly took place in the past week and followed information provided by western intelligence agencies in the past fortnight. Lebanese security officials described the woman as a high-value catch and said the identity of the boy was confirmed through DNA testing. If so, the revelation would support the claim of international involvement. The US and other states have samples of Baghdadis DNA from the nine months he spent in US custody in Iraq in 2004. The British Foreign Office said it had nothing to add to the reports. Analysts in Iraq said that, if true, the arrest would not necessarily yield useful intelligence. The self-styled leader of the new Islamic caliphate, which covers part of eastern Syria and Iraq, operates in an exclusively male world where women are rarely empowered. Baghdadi is believed to have three wives, two of them Iraqi and one Syrian. It is close to impossible that she would have operational details, said an Iraqi intelligence officer. But she could still be useful on things like locations. Baghdadi is known to move frequently across Iraqs north-west, where he has been the target of an intensive technical effort to track him by the US National Security Agency and Britains GCHQ. He uses trusted couriers to pass vital information, often in written letters, or repeated orally. The FBI has put a $10m (6.4m) bounty on Baghdadis head. Al-Safir, the Lebanese news magazine, which first reported the arrest, said the woman and her son were arrested near the restive border town of Arsal and were being detained at Lebanons military headquarters in the hills overlooking Beirut. The woman was identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi, by a Lebanese security official and a senior political source. Dulaimi was one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 nuns taken captive by al-Qaida-linked militants in Syria, according to media reports at the time. The arrest could be used as a bargaining chip against Isis, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners. There was no immediate reaction on Isis websites, but in a possible Isis reprisal at least six Lebanese soldiers were killed on Tuesday by gunmen from Syria who attacked an army patrol near the border. Isis continues to pose a mortal threat to Iraqs central government and to the opposition and regime in Syria where a devastating civil war is nearing its fourth year. The Iraqi and Syrian militaries have tried to mount counteroffensives against the group in past weeks, with mixed success. However, neither they nor US-led air strikes have wound back the spectacular gains the group enjoyed from June to August when it rampaged through northern Iraq as the Iraqi army withdrew. Meanwhile, Isis supporters released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month. The video posted online by the Al-Battar Media Foundation shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man in the car, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The videos authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants. Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving November 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name. If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by IS supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia. The video also includes audio clips of IS group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom. In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters on Tuesday that the Dane is doing better.

No evidence has emerged to back up her alleged capture. The Jerusalem Post contacted Shin Bet, Israel's security service, and was told ""there are no further details at this stage."" An article posted on LiveLeak (see below) claims that Kurdish forces have denied her capture, but that has not been corroborated.",http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Report-ISIS-kidnaps-former-IDF-Canadian-Israeli-soldier-who-went-to-fight-with-the-Kurds-383238,No Error,"Uncertainty abounds concerning the fate of Israeli-Canadian Gill Rosenberg, who was reportedly captured by Islamic State. Islamist websites  some of them known to be close to, or even serving as a front for, the terrorist organization  reported Sunday that the 31-year-old adventurer was captured during fierce battles with Kurdish fighters in unspecified areas. According to the websites, Rosenberg was taken hostage following three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters had barricaded themselves.The websites gave no further details regarding the circumstances of the capture, nor provided any proof of it.The Islamic State claims do not make clear whether Rosenberg was captured in Iraq or in Syria. The main battlefield between the Kurds and Islamic State is in the Syrian- Turkish border town of Kobani.Kurdish sources approached by Israel Radio reporter Eran Cicurel expressed doubt over the Islamic State report. They said Rosenberg was not in Kobani. In the assessment of these Kurdish sources, the reports of Rosenbergs capture are probably the terrorists propaganda.The Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) told The Jerusalem Post that there are no further details at this stage.Rosenberg wrote on her Facebook page on November 20 that she was handing over management of her account to someone else and would be without Internet access for at least two weeks, until December 8, she wrote. It is not clear where she went at this time.If the websites reports are true, Rosenberg would be the first confirmed Western female to fall into Islamic State captivity. Holding Israeli citizenship would complicate her situation even further.Unlike the US and the UK, which refused to negotiate over their respective captured nationals, thus giving the impression of a laissez-faire interest, Israel invests intense concern into the fate of its citizens captured by terrorists.This does not mean Israel will negotiate for Rosenberg, if she has indeed been captured  or that Islamic State would agree to talk with Israel, making her nationality Canadian alone.If Rosenberg is in captivity, she would be the second Israeli  of dual nationality  in this position. Steven Sotloff, a freelance American journalist who also held Israeli citizenship and filed for The Jerusalem Report on the Syrian civil war, was captured by Islamic State last year shortly after crossing the Syrian border and beheaded by the Islamist group this past August.As well, Rosenberg breached Israeli law by flying to Iraq, an enemy country, which Israeli citizens are forbidden to enter.No matter what has happened to her since joining the Kurdish forces, upon return to Israel she will be arrested and prosecuted, as was the case of several Israeli Arabs who joined Islamic State and subsequently returned to Israel.This is not Rosenbergs first tryst with adventurism  in 2009 she was arrested in an American con scandal and sentenced to four years in jail. This is, however, her first serious willful encounter with death.Rosenberg was born in Vancouver, and experienced a family crisis after her parents divorced. In an interview with Maariv in 2009, she said that already at the age of 22 she was pursuing a promising career as a pilot of Boeing passenger planes, but decided to leave everything behind and immigrate in 2006. In Israel, she joined the IDF, serving as an instructor for Kenyan soldiers who came to Israel for home front search and rescue training.Rosenberg said she had ambitions to join the Mossad, but was hurt during her military training and afterwards had money problems.She met an American friend in an ulpan Hebrew language course who led her into crime, she said.She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme. According to the indictments filed against them, they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps even millions, from the unknowing pensioners.After a number of complaints were filed, a joint Israel Police and FBI investigation was launched. The probe led to the arrest of several suspects and their extradition to the US, where they were tried. Rosenberg served four years in jail.She may have decided to fulfill an act of redemption after getting out of jail and regaining her freedom.Hopefully the Kurdish sources are right, and Rosenberg is indeed far from executioners.Canada is trying to confirm reports that Rosenberg has been captured, a foreign ministry spokesman said Sunday.Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information and is in touch with local authorities, the spokesman said in a statement.Yossi Melman is an Israeli journalist and writer who specializes in security and intelligence affairs.

",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2836124/GOT-Jihadi-John-wounded-airstrike-Foreign-Office-confirms-MOS-aware-reports-injury.html,No Error,"Jihadi John, the Briton who beheaded two British and two American hostages held by Islamic State terrorists, has been injured in a US-led air strike, according to reports received by the Foreign Office. The masked executioner with a London accent is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit of the groups leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday. The meeting was targeted by American and Iraqi jets. Scroll down for video The US Air Force attacked a bunker where Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Jihadi John were meeting in Iraq We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them, a Foreign Office spokesman told The Mail on Sunday. This newspaper has received an independent account of how Jihadi John was injured and rushed to hospital after a devastating air strike in Al Qaim, in Anbar Province, Western Iraq. The Foreign Office spokesman added: We have a number of sources of information coming in. The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days. We dont have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports. The Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports. A spokesman for US Central Command said they were unable to confirm the details for security reasons. The joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured. Those reportedly hurt included IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. But until now, Jihadi Johns presence at the meeting has not emerged. It is also not known whether Jihadi John was intentionally targeted or merely happened to be present. The secret, heavily guarded meeting took place last Saturday in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in Al Qaim. At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to our well-placed Syrian source. He said Jihadi John, as a senior IS figure in his own right, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was also present. Sources claim that Jihadi John, pictured, was injured and rushed to hospital following the surgical airstrike in Iraq which killed ten ISIS commanders, the killer, who has a London accent, murdered Steven Sotloff Jihadi John was also responsible for the murder of British aid worker Alan Henning, left According to our source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, saying it was the one who slaughtered the journalists. It is not clear how seriously the British fanatic was hurt, but the source said that both he and Al-Baghdadi were rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment. IS members issued urgent calls through the local mosques loudspeakers, appealing for the towns residents to donate blood at the hospital. Our source, who does not want to be identified for his own safety, added that Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and the other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelling 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa. The injured were taken to two captured Syrian army barracks near the city in the hope that underground medical facilities there would provide protection against further air strikes. The source said that hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, once the HQs of the Assad regimes 17th Division and 93rd Brigade. Jihadi John, right, became one of the world's most wanted terrorists after he murdered James Foley, left Jihadi John, who also murdered David Haines, left, is believed to live in the Syrian town of Al Bukamal Jihadi John has become one of the worlds most hunted terrorists after beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31. Footage of the atrocities has been released online, and in the most recent gruesome execution video of Mr Henning, put out last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker. British journalist John Cantlie, also held hostage, has been forced to appear in a series of internet propaganda videos for IS. Our source, who has contacts with the IS leadership in Syria, also throws fresh light on the role played by Jihadi John within the terrorist group. Unlike most other western Muslim recruits, he has risen to a position of some seniority. Normally, Western fighters occupy lowly positions, mainly being used as foot soldiers or performing guard duty. Although believed to formerly have been a prison guard for IS, Jihadi John was made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS wilayat, or province. IS is now controlling large areas of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared an Islamic caliphate. Jihadi John is understood to be in the shura council for the wilayat of Al Furat, an area that straddles the Syria-Iraq border and includes Al Qaim, the scene of the air strike. Our source added that Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa, but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq. He is aged between 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, the language of the Koran, according to our source. He first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria. The raid is believed to have injured the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pictured The source said that Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and he has six other British terrorists with him who act as his bodyguards. In the confusion following the bombing last weekend, rumours swiftly spread that IS leader Al-Baghdadi had been killed. Last week, in order to scotch those rumours, he issued a 17-minute audio recording, exhorting extremists to erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere. The Mail on Sunday has obtained an Iraqi intelligence document from the Federal Intelligence and Investigation unit of the Ministry of Interior, which outlines last Saturdays attack. The document said that Al-Baghdadi was wearing black and first went to a kindergarten building before going to have lunch at an IS leaders house. It is believed that the air strikes took place when he was meeting the other leaders in a bunker beneath that property. It is understood that Jihadi John has been moved to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria, pictured Muhammad Nasser Delli, an MP for Anbar province, told The Mail on Sunday that local residents confirmed to him that they saw Al-Baghdadi being treated at Al Qaim. He said: A number of people saw him there, but he did not stay at the hospital long. There were lots of women and children that were killed on Saturday during the air strikes. The Iraqi intelligence paper also states that Al-Baghdadi was taken to Al Qaim hospital, before being driven to Syria. It lists 16 IS leaders as having been killed in the attack, and nine injured. Among the dead are Abu Huzaifa Al-Adnany, a security guard to Al-Baghdadi, and Abu Quatayba, the cleric of Al Furat wilaya, who would sit in the same shura council as Jihadi John.",Got him!

The lure of you is precisely why Nabet announced yesterday that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice will cover any womens eyes that are deemed tempting. The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones he said. [We] have the right to do so. What are tempting eyes? One Saudi journalist mused on condition of anonymity that they are uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble. The Orwellian-named committee did not provide a definition of tempting, but if they happen to rely on Merriam-Webster, then it means having an appeal. What is an appeal? According to the dictionary, it is arousing a sympathetic response. And what is sympathetic? Showing empathy, according to Merriam-Webster. So there you have it. To allow a womens eyes to capture the unfettered glory of the world, one must empathize with her very existence. But the religious policemassively funded by King Abdullahcannot do this. Its so stupid, the Saudi journalist tells me. I dont know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They wont be silent. Perhaps they wont be, but the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has some of the most powerful backers in the country. Prince Naif, recently appointed heir to the throne, has said: The committee is supported by all sides ... It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee. No surprise, then, that King Abdullah awarded this draconian body an additional 200 million riyals (about $53 million) in March. How should America respond to this latest affront to Saudi women? Perhaps it can sponsor a contest of the most tempting eyes in Saudi Arabia. Women will send in pictures of their most tempting look and the winner will get to accompany President Obama during his next meeting with the Saudi dictator. If Congress reconsidered the recent $60 billion U.S.-Saudi arms deal, the religious police might quickly find it tempting to stop treating women as property.",Saudi Arabia's Religious Police Outlaw 'Tempting Eyes',2011-11-19,David Keyes

Boko Haram did not immediately confirm the ceasefire, or the related release of the girls.",http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/11169959/Nigerias-missing-schoolgirls-to-be-released-after-ceasefire-deal.html,No Error,"Nigerias government and Boko Haram have agreed a ceasefire that brings closer the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in the north of the country more than six months ago. Secret meetings held between the authorities in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, and representatives of the al-Qaeda-linked militia have led to an temporary agreement to lay down arms. Part of the deal includes the need to rescue all the captives of the terrorists, including the students of Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, said Mike Omeri, anti-terrorism spokesman of the presidents national information centre. There would also be an immediate ceasefire, with Boko Haram apparently saying it would suspend its bombing and kidnap campaign, and the Nigerian army agreeing not to target suspected militant camps. From the discussions, [Boko Harams representatives] indicated their desire for, and willingness to discuss and resolve all associated issues, Mr Omeri said. They also assured that the school girls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well. The announcement came days after protesters marched in Abuja to mark the six-month anniversary of the girls abduction. Close to 300 teenage girls were kidnapped by armed gunmen as they were driven back to their school in coaches after an excursion. Some managed to escape, but an estimated 219 are still being held captive, reportedly in Nigerias neighbour, Cameroon, whose military was involved in the ceasefire talks. There was immediate scepticism, however. One Western diplomat in Lagos, Nigerias coastal commercial capital, pointed out that Goodluck Jonathan, the president, is in the middle of campaigning for the presidential elections due next year. Hes having a tough run with Boko Haram, and he needs a boost, the diplomat said. Its the main thing that people are concerned about, security. If he can score a ceasefire, great. If he can bring the girls back, even better. But weve not yet heard from Boko Haram. Until then, were taking this with a little salt. Aid groups working to secure the release of the schoolgirls welcomed the news, but also remained cautious. This ceasefire is incredibly promising, but we arent there yet, said Hussaini Abdu, country director for ActionAid Nigeria. Until every girl is released negotiations must continue. We are excited about the possibility of restoring peace in the country, but these girls must remain a priority and we therefore urge the government to ensure that the safety of all of them is guaranteed as part of any truce. Britain is among several nations that has offered assistance to the Nigerian government and its military to help find the missing schoolgirls. Privately, Western security sector sources in the country report exasperation among those coming to help over the slow pace of the Nigerians reactions to the kidnap crisis. The girls are understood to have been separated into several groups, making an armed rescue far more complicated and dangerous, leaving talks as the only likely route to their release. Boko Haram has in the past insisted that it would only release the teenagers if Nigeria freed several of the groups senior commanders, who have been captured and are in jail. There were no immediate details of what Boko Haram will get out of the ceasefire deal. The group has been blamed for hundreds of killings in bomb or gun attacks, and it is increasingly choosing targets over an ever wider area of northern Nigeria. It began as a local militia targeting people who broke strict Islamic regulations such as drinking alcohol. But it recently linked with al-Qaedas franchise in West Africa, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and appears to have taken on far more ambitious aims, including ridding northern Nigeria of Christians. Boko Harams leader, Abubakar Shekau, frequently justifies attacks on Christians as revenge for killings of Muslims in Nigerias volatile Middle Belt, where the largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north meet. The Telegraph revealed last month that the International Committee of the Red Cross had become involved in a secret prisoner swap deal that would ensure the schoolgirls' return. Officials from the Geneva-based organisation sat in on talks between the Nigerian government and a senior Boko Haram leader that was being held in one of the country's maximum security prisons. The Red Cross officials also visited a number of other jails, identifying a list of 16 senior commanders that Boko Haram wants freed in exchange for the 219 hostages kidnapped from the north-east town of Chibok. The ICRC's role in the talks represented the first official confirmation that the Nigerian government was actively engaged in talks with Boko Haram. Publicly, Nigeria's president, Goodluck Jonathan, has previously maintained that the government would never agree to any kind of negotiations.","Nigeria's missing girls 'to be released by Boko Haram', government aide claims",,Mike Pflanz

The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria. U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes. They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein, Abdulrahman said. People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back, he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border. Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report. It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military. U.S. MILITARY KEEPING CLOSE EYE Were not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere, U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State. We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be. General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. militarys Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State. We dont have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I dont have any information on that either, he told a Pentagon news briefing. Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats. The countryside east of Aleppo city is one of the main bases of Islamic State in Syria. The al Qaeda offshoot controls up to a third of the territory of Syria, whose civil war pitting various rebel groups against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has raged for more than three years.

The second militant was allegedly killed for dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen. The electronic chips are understood to be a reference to electronic chips used for geo-location of targets in air strikes. There are unconfirmed reports that the men were beheaded, although Isis (also known as Islamic State) have also been known to crucify people. Charlie Winter, Programs Officer at counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, said reports of Isis executing their own fighters are unsurprising. He told The Independent: Isis is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them.

http://www.emergent.info/kim-jong-un-hurt-leg,World,Unverified,Claim: Kim Jong Un hurt his leg during military exercises,He reportedly needs 100 days to recover from an injury suffered while training with generals.,,Jul 3,"Reuters first reported it on Oct. 9, citing ""a source with access to the secretive North's leadership.""",http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/09/us-northkorea-kim-idUSKCN0HY09T20141009,No Error,"BEIJING/SEOUL  - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to the secretive Norths leadership said, playing down speculation over the 31-year-olds health and grip on power. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (4th R) visits the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun to pay tribute to founding President Kim Il Sung and former leader Kim Jong Il to mark the 61st anniversary of the victory of the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War, in this photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang July 27, 2014. REUTERS/KCNA North Koreas state media, which usually chronicles Kims whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on Sept. 3, and Kim was absent from early state media coverage of a major political anniversary on Friday. In the previous two years, Kim marked the anniversary of the founding of North Koreas Workers Party with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred. Last year, that visit was covered about four hours later by the states KCNA news agency, and by the daily Rodong Sinmun newspaper. As of about 8 a.m. (7.00 p.m. EDT) on Friday, there was no KCNA report of an event at the mausoleum. Fridays Rodong Sinmun could not yet be seen on its website. Kims father, Kim Jong Il, did not always attend the Oct. 10 memorial event when he was in power. The source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing, said on Thursday that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises. He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened, the source said. Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with important officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury. Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified. Kim Jong Un is in total control, said the source. Kims absence from public view is fuelling speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle. The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow, said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. NOT KIMS FIRST ABSENCE North Korean officials have denied that Kims public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble. It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view. In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days. He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium. Speculation that Kims unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fueled by a North Korean television report late last month that said he was suffering from discomfort. Some North Korea watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang. The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Uns health said rumors of a coup were rubbish. It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans, said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based group running a program for North Koreans in Southeast Asia. North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centered on the ruling Kim family. Kims sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye. Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme Peoples Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago. However, Kims name has not disappeared from state propaganda. Thursdays edition of the Rodong Sinmun carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked the Marshal for his support during the competition. Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped. Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing, he said.","North Korea leader Kim is still in charge, has leg injury: source",2014-10-09,Benjamin Kang Lim
http://www.emergent.info/ISIS-fighters-border,World,false,Claim: ISIS fighters were caught trying to enter the U.S. via the U.S.-Mexico border,U.S. Border Patrol allegedly caught the men.,ISIS,Jul 3,"it was made by U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan, of South Carolina, while on Fox News on Oct. 7.",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/08/congressman-at-least-10-isis-fighters-caught-trying-to-cross-into-us/,No Error,"A Republican congressman claimed Tuesday that ""at least 10"" Islamic State ""fighters"" have been caught trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border into Texas, though an administration official denied it. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said he learned the information from the Border Patrol, warning that the alleged attempts to cross into the U.S. raise serious security concerns. ""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" he told Fox News. ""They aren't flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico."" Hunter continued: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas."" He claimed Border Patrol ""caught them,"" but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol."" The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday denied Hunter's claim. ""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" a senior DHS spokesman said. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border."" But Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said the information -- that about 10 individuals with ""known ISIS affiliations"" -- came from a ""high-level source within the Border Patrol."" ""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"" Kasper said. ""It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it's been that way for a long time and we don't expect that to change."" Obama administration officials previously have downplayed the threat of Islamic State militants infiltrating the U.S. through the southern border, as warnings about that possibility have circulated. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in an interview with Fox News last week, acknowledged reports that four men with suspected terror ties had been apprehended at the southern border in Texas and questioned. But Johnson said they were ""scrutinized very, very carefully"" and officials found ""no evidence that these individuals were tied to terrorism."" Border Patrol and Homeland Security sources also told Fox News that they have not been able to substantiate Hunter's claim. They said between Sept. 23 and Oct. 6, only five illegal immigrants from ""special interest"" countries were arrested at the Texas border -- and they were from Bangladesh. The four men that Johnson referred to were actually Kurds, Fox News is told. Johnson, at a hearing last month, stressed that the government had ""no specific intelligence or evidence to suggest at present that ISIL is attempting to infiltrate this country though our southern border."" At the same hearing, National Counterterrorism Center head Matthew Olsen also said: ""There has been a very small number of sympathizers with ISIL who have posted messages on social media about this, but we've seen nothing to indicate there is any sort of operational effort or plot to infiltrate or move operatives from ISIL"" into the U.S. through the southern border. Still, Johnson said the U.S. needs to be ""vigilant"" and aware of the possibility of ""potential infiltration by ISIL or any other terrorist group."" The union representing America's immigration caseworkers also sounded an urgent warning last month about the threat. Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, alleged the administration has made it easier for terrorists to ""exploit"" the country's visa policies and enter the homeland. He complained that the administration has ""widened the loophole"" they could use through the asylum system, and has restricted agents from going after many of those who overstay their visas. Further, he warned that executive orders being contemplated by President Obama would ""legalize visa overstays"" and raise ""the threat level to America even higher."" He said there is ""no doubt"" many are already being ""targeted for radicalization.""

I was surprised there was so little compassion, Diane Foley told ABC News today of the three separate warnings she said U.S. officials gave the family about the illegality of paying ransom to the terror group ISIS. It just made me realize that these people talking to us had no idea what it was like to be the family of someone abducted Im sure [the U.S. official] didnt mean it the way he said it, but we were between a rock and a hard place. We were told we could do nothing meanwhile our son was being beaten and tortured every day. Earlier this week five current and former officials with direct knowledge of the Foley case confirmed the alleged threats were made. ""It was an utterly idiotic thing to do that came across as if [the U.S. official] had the compassion of an anvil,"" said a former official who has advised the family. Digital Feature: Inside Terrorist Hostage Negotiations Could Money Have Saved James Foley? Video Appears to Show Beheading of US Journalist James Foley Nicole Tung/AP Photo Diane Foley told ABC News earlier this week that warnings over the summer came primarily from a highly decorated military officer serving on the White House's National Security Council staff. James Foleys brother, Michael, also told ABC News that he was directly threatened with possible prosecution by a State Department official. It was very upsetting because we were essentially told to trust that the way they were handling things would bring our son home, Diane Foley said. The U.S. government did try to rescue James Foley along with other American and European hostages from an ISIS stronghold in Syria in early July, but by the time the elite commandos arrived at the location, the hostages had been moved. Foley was executed weeks later by a self-professed ISIS militant. Digital Globe Diane Foley said the family believed they knew where their son was being held prior to his execution, but other than the July rescue mission, it didnt seem like anything was being done. But were not politicians, were not government people, we dont know, she said. Diane Foley said the problem was that the family had no idea because the government didnt tell them. At times, Diane Foley said the family had to beg the government for information on their son. We were an annoyance, it felt, at some level They didnt have time for us, she said. Today White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said that government officials were in constant contact with the Foley family and declined to comment on the alleged ransom warnings, telling reporters hes not going to be in a position to detail the kinds of conversations that took place so often between members of the administration and the Foley family. It is a long standing policy of this administration, it was the policy of previous administrations that ransoms should not be paid to terrorist organizations, Earnest said before referring more specific questions about the Foleys situation to the Justice Department. Secretary of State John Kerry today told reporters that he was really taken aback [and] surprised by Foleys allegations. I can tell you that I am totally unaware and would not condone anybody that I know of within the State Department making such statements, Kerry said. State Department spokesperson Marie Harf today denied the State Department told the family they could be prosecuted for paying ransom, only that the department helps hostage families understand what our laws are about terrorists or paying ransom to terrorists. But this department would never and did not ever intend nor do we think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening, Harf said. Obtained by ABC News Thursday an NSC spokeswoman also said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied the family was told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment. ""Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families, the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL [ISIS], are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement. The spokeswoman also asked ABC News to withhold the military officer's name for fear his personal security could be compromised by those who might wrongly blame U.S. officials for Foley's slaughter at the hands of ISIS militants who may never have considered sparing him for any price. Diane Foley did not disclose how much her family had raised before his high-profile public execution but she and a surviving son, Michael, said that the administration's intimidation tactics succeeded. ""It slowed my parents down quite a bit. They didn't want to do anything that could get them in trouble. It slowed them down for months in raising money. Who knows what might have happened?"" Michael Foley said. The family launched the James W. Foley Legacy Fund this week, which in large part is intended to help other hostages' loved ones navigate the frustrating currents they encountered both with the terrorists and with their own government. Two American and several British hostages remain in ISIS captivity. Asked whether she had believed ISIS would accept a ransom payment and free their son, as they had many European hostages liberated for between $2-3 million each, Diane Foley replied, ""I do, maybe -- I mean, who knows?"" ""ISIS is a very brutal group. They may have already decided, that Jim and the others were Americans and they were going to kill him,"" Diane Foley said. In the end, Diane Foley said she didn't want to blame anyone for what happened to her son, but said that when it comes to the U.S. governments treatment of the families of hostages, As Americans, we can do better.

http://www.emergent.info/human-death-GMO,Viral,false,Claim: Doctors confirmed the first case of death by genetically modified food,,Fake News&Hoaxes&World News Daily Report,Jul 3,The fake news website World News Daily Report published this article on Jan. 18. It has over time garnered a large number of shares and has spread to other languages. ,http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/doctors-confirm-first-human-death-officially-caused-by-gmos/,No Error,"Madrid | Doctors of the Carlos III hospital confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first case of human death caused by the ingestion of genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died from anaphylaxis after eating some recently developed tomatoes containing fish genes, which provoked a violent and lethal allergic reaction. This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31-year old Spanish man who died at the Madrid hospital at the beginning of January. The young mans health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction, and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient. The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death. Mr. Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, when he started feeling ill just after lunch. A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves, including a violent itchy rash, some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure. The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected himself some epinephrine, but his health condition continued to deteriorate. The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co-workers, but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital. The medical examiners and forensic experts at the Carlos III hospital had to execute a lot of tests and analysis before they could precisely determine what caused Mr. Ramos to die of an allergic reaction to seafood since all he had eaten before his death was a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich with a diet cola. They were astonished when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested, not only contained some fish-related allergens, but also some antibiotic resistant genes which had prevented Mr. Ramos white blood cell from saving his life. At first we thought that there had been some form of contamination of his food, from contact with fish or seafood during the preparation explained Dr. Rafael Prez-Santamarina. It was only when we tested the tomato itself that we noticed that it contained some allergens usually found in seafood. We did many different analysis and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of the allergens that killed Mr. Ramos. The case of Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed to be linked to the ingestion of genetically modified food. It contradicts most studies on GMOs which had concluded that genetically engineered crops currently on the market were completely safe to eat. A team led by University of Nebraska scientists had anticipated this kind of problem in 1996 when they found that a Brazil nut protein introduced to improve the nutritional quality of genetically modified soybeans was able to provoke an allergic reaction in people with Brazil nut allergies. However, this kind of problem was dismissed by most scientists as very improbable, since it could easily be avoided with proper safety testing. The soybean injected with the Brazil nut gene was indeed abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused Mr. Ramos death had not been submitted to sufficient testing and the lethal risk had not been identified before it was marketed.

School children in America, meanwhile, aren't nearly so lucky. Whereas a kid in France might be treated to a juicy steak and a hunk of brie, the richest country in the world's youths are more likely to receive unidentified meat served alongside little more than a starch like white pasta, fries or a roll. The contrasts between America's school meals and those in far less fortunate economies are stark and suggest Michelle Obama's push for more healthful lunches nationwide may not be enough. What is it? School lunches in the United States stand in stark contrast to the wholesome and in some cases even decadent meals served to kids in other markedly less fortunate nations The first new school lunch standards championed by Michelle Obama have been phased in over the last several school years. In addition to whole grain requirements, the rules set fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond. While many schools have had success putting the rules in place, others have said they are too restrictive and costly. Backlash against the rules have spawned a wave of social media photos along with the tag #thanksMichelleObama. If these pictures are any indication, schools have responded to the rules by cutting down on portions to reduce fat and calories rather than by using potentially more costly ingredients. Meanwhile, the widely different meals from Spain, Ukraine, Greece, South Korea, Brazil, France, Finland and Italy are all fresh and wholesome, with fish, steak and vegetables featuring prominently. Photos of the meals appear on Sweetgreen.com. But in the UK and US, lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken, frankfurters, cookies, and beans from a tin.

In late Feb., the Sydney Morning Herald reported on the case, setting off a cascade of reports in Western media.

Hans Raj, the petitioner, told Hindustan Times, The culture of initiating female devotees as full-timers was started by Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim and he was concerned about possible sexual advances by male full-timers (sadhus). Such followers, who would become impotent, can be used as potent weapon against his enemies. Hans Raj was a sadhu in Dera Sacha Sauda from 1996 to 2012 and worked as a musician for Dera chiefs religious programmes. Hans Raj said he was awed by Dera chiefs power. But when one after another sadhus who dared to raise voice against the chief were eliminated, he decided to face his fear by filing petition for a CBI probe in July, 2012. The court had then directed the state government to investigate the case and a medical examination found his testis surgically removed, which is in sync with his claims that over 400 followers were castrated at Sirsa Dera. On why they agreed to undergo castration, Gurdas Singh Toor alias Bitu (46), a witness in this case, claimed it was done on the pretext that removing testis would lead to salvation. Castrated followers were not allowed to meet their family or venture outside DSS campus on their own, he said. While handing over the probe to CBI, the HC had observed that Haryana polices investigation was worthless. Dera Sacha Sauda spokesperson Dr Aditya Insan rubbished the allegations. He said all the allegations were false and baseless and the petitioner in the case had left dera 3 years ago.

During that time, Father John Micheal ONeal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure. The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm. The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered. The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light. He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like Being of Light. Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting states the Catholic priest. She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mothers embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesnt disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more! The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the Catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors. Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father ONeal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the Holy Mother. I wish to continue preaching says the elderly cleric. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians.

The Post reported that Burton and a friend wanted to display Manson's body in a ""bizarre California version of Lenin’s Tomb"" in order to ""draw huge crowds and make big money."" (Burton and Manson's marriage license recently expired.) Gawker's Antiviral blog did a good job of unpacking the claim, noting that neither Burton nor Manson have commented, and that nothing currently backs up Simone's claim. It's also worth noting that Simone is seeking a publisher for his book, and making this claim has given him attention for the project. This is Unverified until evidence emerges either way.",http://nypost.com/2015/02/08/charles-mansons-fiancee-wanted-to-marry-him-for-his-corpse-source/,No Error,"This plot was too crazy even for Charles Manson. Mansons engagement to a woman 53 years his junior was part of a wild scheme of hers to profit by putting his body on public display after his death, says the author of an upcoming book. Mansons fiance, 27-year-old Afton Elaine Burton, known as Star, sought to wed the convicted mastermind of the Sharon Tate murder and eight other slayings so that she could gain possession of his corpse, according to journalist Daniel Simone. Burton and a pal, Craig Hammond, planned to lay out Mansons remains in a glass crypt, Simone says. The pair figured their bizarre California version of Lenins Tomb would draw huge crowds and make big money. But Manson, 80, does not want to marry Burton and has no interest in spending eternity displayed in a glass coffin, Simone told The Post. Hes finally realized that hes been played for a fool, Simone said. Another reason the madman balked at the plan is because he believes he is immortal. He feels he will never die, Simone said. Therefore, he feels its a stupid idea to begin with. Mansons and Burtons marriage license expired Thursday. They plan on renewing the license, and things will move forward in the coming months, says a statement posted on Burtons and Hammonds website. Burton and Hammond  who uses the nickname Gray Wolf  could not be reached for comment. The wedding was postponed due to an unexpected interruption in logistics, the site says. Manson entered a prison medical facility for treatment of an infection about two months ago and cannot receive visitors, Simone said. California prison officials would not comment on either Mansons medical condition or his whereabouts. Simone and a collaborator, Heidi Jordan Ley, are seeking a publisher for their book, The Retrial of Charles Manson. Manson and other inmates at Corcoran State Prison in California are helping the project. The authors say they spoke with Manson regularly before his phone privileges were suspended two years ago. They also corresponded with Manson and his inmate friends by mail. According to the authors, Burton and Hammond hatched their plan to display Mansons corpse about two years ago. Initially, the duo asked Manson to sign a document that would let them take his body when he dies. He didnt give them a yes, he didnt give them a no. He sort of strung them along, Simone said. Burton and Hammond regularly brought Manson toiletries and other items. Stringing them along kept the goodies coming, Simone said. When it became clear last year that the purportedly death-proof Manson would not green-light the plan, Burton and Hammond switched to the marriage idea, Simone says. If Burton married Manson, the pair realized, California law would give her possession of Mansons remains upon his death, Simone said. Simone believes Manson never intended to marry Burton. Manson never consented to the wedding in the first place and never will, he said. Another Simone book, The Lufthansa Heist, about a $6 million armed robbery at Kennedy Airport in 1978, is due out next month. He co-authored it with GoodFellas mobster Henry Hill, who died in 2012.",Charles Mansons fiance wanted to marry him for his corpse: source,2015-02-08,February

Its been his ever since and is the only toy in the house the other animals dont dare touch. The niece did receive a holiday gift, just not the elephant. UPDATE! September 14, 2016 Its Official, Bart is OURS! After 20 months in our care, countless hours of paperwork, and millions of prayers and well-wishes from across the world, we finally have been legally granted ownership of Bart the Miracle Cat to the Humane Society of Tampa Bay! But he was only ours for a few hours as his foster family prepared to make his place in their home permanent. At 1:00pm Wednesday, September 14th at our shelter we celebrated the end of the custody battle and, consequently, his adoption, with a Gotcha Day party (Gotcha Days are adoption birthdays in the animal welfare world). In January 2015 Bart became an internet sensation after being hit by a car, buried alive, and clawing his way out of his grave. He ended up at our animal hospital where we preformed extensive surgery to repair his broken jaw, remove his eye, and nurse him back to strength and health. The questionable circumstances surrounding his injuries led us to fight for his custody so that we could find him a loving home. To many he became known as Zombie Cat but to us hes always been nothing short of a miracle. Not because we believe he rose from the dead, but because his gentle spirit, will to survive, and resilience in the face of extreme trauma embody all that we love and admire about animals. He is truly an ambassador for second chances and continues to inspire people the world over. We love you, Bart, always and forever. We know you havent heard from Bart in awhile, but he is still doing GREAT! In fact, he recently got visits from a couple of his fans. First, he and this special young lady really bonded when she was with us for Critter Camp. When he saw her last week he got so excited and rolled right over so that she could pet him. Second, this wonderful lady has been following his story since the beginning and came by to see how healthy and happy he has become. He was happy to show her the ropes of life at HSTB (sleep, eat, play, snuggle, repeat).

January 13, 2016 See how Bart is doing nearly one year after being hit by a car, buried alive, and clawing from his grave! Thanks to FOX 13 News for shooting the footage. UPDATE! January 1, 2016 Happy New Year from our sweet boy, Bart! As you can see, he is fairly unimpressed with the festivities UPDATE! November 29, 2015 Looks like Bart had a little to much Thanksgiving. Well, he deserves it! UPDATE! October 30, 2015 You asked for it, you got it! Many of you have been wondering how our famous, one-eyed friend is doing. Well, hes fantastic and happier than ever, and were still waiting on the courts to decide custody. Here, he is guarding the entrance to the break area where the staff keeps their snacks because, you know, he gets first dibs. UPDATE! September 22, 2015 Here is a picture of handsome Bart taking a moment out of his play time to pose for the camera. Such a silly kitty. He is doing well, loving life and getting more spoiled by the day. Still no news on the legal case with his previous owner so for now hes still living it up at HSTB. UPDATE! July 22, 2015 It was a snuggle up and nap kind of day for Bart. Or, is that the Princess and the Pea? Whichever, the more layers of fluff, the better the snooze! Still no update on the pending court case, we apologize! UPDATE! June 25, 2015 We post a lot about how much love Bart is getting, and he is! BUT, we may have neglected to inform you about how much love and joy he brings to US! He is a courageous, friendly, silly and affectionate kitty who greets us each day with happy enthusiasm and makes us laugh with his goofy way of jumping on our keyboards and trying to eat our lunches. Here, he made a volunteers day by giving her a cuddle and a kiss when she went visited him over the weekend. UPDATE! June 19, 2015 While we dont have any information to share about the court case (still in process) we do have a cute picture to share. Yesterday, Bart got a visit from an avid fan and had a wonderful time showing off his skills with his favorite toys. The little girl had so much fun, she and her mom went out and bought him a laser toy then came back to give it to him and play some more UPDATE! June 8, 2015 While there is still no news about the ongoing court case, we can report that Bart is doing very well in our care. He is a happy, playful and affectionate kitty who LOVES to meet new friends, like the little girl pictured here. She came in with her mom to finish registering for Critter Camp and was so excited to meet Bart. They played together for quite awhile and were sure shell be back to say hello. UPDATE! May 12, 2015 Bart had to share his space with a former adoptable who was visiting for the day. Bert the gentle giant, and Bart the feisty feline were doing great until the unknowing pit mix traveled too close to the room where Barts food is kept (behind and to the left of Bart). At that point there was a hallway stare down with kitty growls and doggie whimpers. The poor, intimidated pup quickly loped off to find a different office to nap in while Bart pranced around in victory. Note: Bert belongs to a staff member and is gentle with cats. We know him very well and he was supervised at all times, as was Bart. UPDATE! April 29, 2015 This lovely Canadian family was vacationing in Tampa Bay and took time out of their week to come visit with Bart! He loved meeting them and showing the children how good he was at chasing his toys around the desk. Hes an international star who just wants to be snuggled and loved! UPDATE! April 24, 2015 Its getting pretty warm here in Tampa Bay, so Bart spent this lazy, hazy afternoon fishing. UPDATE! April 16, 2015 Bart helps comfort a nervous kitten who recently arrived at the shelter. UPDATE! April 14, 2015 Bart got a visit from a two-legged friend who came by to read him a story before his afternoon nap. [easingslider id=24342] UPDATE! April 13, 2015 Today, depositions began in the custody case for Bart. Ellis Hutson and Dusty Allbritton were deposed today and HSTB Executive Director Sherry Silk will be deposed next week. We wanted to let you all know that the case is in process. We are still hopeful of a victory so that Bart can continue to thrive (see pictures above) and find a loving forever home. UPDATE! April 2, 2015 Is Jack searching the basket for the perfect toy to share with his friend, Bart? Or is he simply hoarding all the goods? Either way, these two are TOO CUTE together! UPDATE! April 1, 2015 No April Fools joke here, Jack actually allowed Bart to nap in his favorite purple bed! They are becoming fast friends. Unfortunately, our staff member was without a desktop for a little while! UPDATE! March 30, 2015 Bart is a happy camper as he recently got the wires removed from his jaw and received some further repair to his palate. Dr. Justin Boorstein is very happy with his healing progress and how well he came through the surgery, although it will still be quite some time before his mouth is completely healed. He said that Bart should soon be able to start eating dry food again! In the picture above, he is happily giving himself a post-surgical bath while overseeing some of the staff in their office. UPDATE! March 25, 2015 Today, our good friends from Humane Society of Pinellas came by for a visit and got to play with Bart. He showed them his favorite toy and how he has mastered the art of snagging that ribbon! UPDATE! March 20, 2015 Bart got a visit from some young fans today and got to take his first unselfie with them! He continues to do well and will most likely get the wires removed from his jaw in the next two weeks. Well keep you updated! UPDATE! March 12, 2015 Bart got a visit from some very generous fans who personally presented him with his very own stroller! They wanted him to be able to get some fresh air, safely! These wonderful ladies from Sunshine Accessories in Tarpon Springs had a great time visiting with Bart and introducing him to his new ride. We cant thank them enough! UPDATE! March 11, 2015 Today, the author of Buzz Beau Blatt the Wonder Cat sent Dr. Justin Boorstein (Barts surgeon) a signed copy of her childrens book In Honor of Bart! As you can see, Bart was much more interested in a snuggle with his favorite doc, but thats OK; this book will be perfect for our Critter Camp to help teach humane values and the resilience of animals! Thank you, Linda Sumas Blatt! UPDATE! March 9, 2015 Bart has received several wonderful beds from fans across the country. Today, he found this one particularly snuggly. The perfect place to spend a Monday, dont you think? Many thanks to all the generous folks who have sent him beds, toys, blankets, treats, cards and well-wishes. UPDATE! March 6, 2015 Bart got a luxurious bath today with a safe whitening shampoo to help make him look even more handsome than he already was! He also got a little bling on his collar and a bow to match. But his favorite part of the pampering session was a post-spa snuggle fest with a favorite staffer. UPDATE! March 5, 2015 Today, the legal process to determine custody of Bart began in court. Over the next few weeks our legal team will conduct discovery into the circumstances surrounding his situation. We will provide legal updates as they come available. In the meantime, Bart continues to do well, making great strides in his recovery, lounging in sunbeams and enjoying attention and affection from volunteers and staff. UPDATE! February 27, 2015 Not only is Bart healing well but he is also making friends! Our former feral boy, Jack, who lives at our administrative building was happy to share his favorite desk with a new friend. He didnt budge from the bed or offer to share, but well give it some time! Were just happy to see Bart acting like a happy, normal cat again! UPDATE! February 25, 2015 Its been a busy day for Mr. Personality! He received a letter from a fan in Germany, a new bed and treats from an admirer in Pittsburgh, and this toy from our staff which he LOVED! You can see from the picture the progression from vague interest to oh I get what Im supposed to do to SUCCESS!. UPDATE! February 23, 2015 We dont have much new to report on the custody case but we can say that Bart is doing fantastic. He is still healing and eating well, and has mastered the litter box! We are so proud of him. Above is a picture of him taking a nap in one of our staffers laps after eating his lunch. UPDATE! February 16, 2015-Bart is thriving under our care, eating well and gaining weight. He is enjoying more mobility and gets frequent visits from staff, volunteers and visitors. He loves the attention and has become quite the cuddle bug. We know there are questions about Barts situation and future stemming from the pending lawsuit with Mr. Hutson. Because this is an open case, there are things about which we cannot go into detail. However, we would like to try and answer some of the most frequently asked questions in the best way we can. QUESTION 1 Why did you change your mind about returning Bart to his owner? We received information that the owner was actually present when Bart was buried and there was a witness claiming the cat was still alive. In addition, we discovered that Bart was not brought to us immediately after he crawled out of the grave. He suffered from severe injuries for at least 2-4 days in the care of his owner before the medical treatment was sought; this is against the law. QUESTION 2 Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center is stating that they have not filed cruelty or neglect charges against the owner. Is that true? Although no charges have been filed to date, we are still hopeful that the county will file charges based on evidence of violation of the following Hillsborough County Ordinances: Sec. 6-21 Rabies Vaccination Requirement Sec. 6-22 Registration & License tags Requirement Sec. 6-24 Display of Tag Requirement; Cat Identification Sec. 6-25 Humane Treatment of Animals Sec. 6-26 Cruelty to Animals Sec. 6-28 Confinement to Property; Dogs and Cats at Large QUESTION 3 Is the Humane Society of Tampa Bay using Bart to line their pockets (raise money)? The Humane Society of Tampa Bay is a Charity Navigator 4-Star Charity for five years running. This is the highest rating possible for fiscal responsibility and transparency. Only 3% of money we receive goes towards administrative costs (including salaries). No ones pockets are being lined. Most importantly, all money we have received as a result of Barts story has gone into a restricted fund called Save-A-Pet Medical Fund to pay for Barts medical care. This money can only be used to cover the cost of medical care for pets, like Bart, whose owners are unable to afford veterinary treatment. So, in actuality, the money weve raised is being given right back to the community by offering free medical treatment to pets in need. In 2014 we provided $53,413 in financial assistance from our Save-A-Pet Medical Fund for the treatment of 261 dogs and cats. QUESTION 4 When will the issue of Barts custody be resolved? As of today, February 16, 2015, a court date has not been set. We will announce the date once it is determined. QUESTION 5 How can I adopt Bart? If you are interested in adopting Bart, please send an email with your contact information to _EMAIL_ and we will add you to the list. Please understand that the list of potential adopters for Bart currently stands at more than 100 individuals. UPDATE! February 11, 2015 On Tuesday, February 10, 2015, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay was served with official Hillsborough County Court documents notifying the Society that it is being sued by Ellis Wayne Hutson for the custody of Bart the cat. Mr. Thomas Gonzalez, of Thompson Sizemore, Gonzalez & Hearing, has agreed to volunteer his time to represent the interests of Sherry Silk, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay, and Bart the cat. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay will review all legal options to keep Bart safe and secure. Bart continues his medical treatment and care at the Societys animal hospital. UPDATE! February 6, 2015 We have some great news about Bart! Check out that empty dish to his right, he is eating like a champ and taking his meds orally with no complaint. When we went to visit him, he was cleaning himself and full of meows and headbutts for us. He is definitely feeling better and his cute little personality is starting to shine through even more. And, we got word from Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center that they will be sending an officer to investigate the situation at the Hutson residence. UPDATE! February 4, 2015 We are so pleased that Bart continues to improve, day by day. Today when we approached his cage, he actually got up and walked to the door to greet us with chirps and meows. He is also showing a good appetite and interest in eating. He still needs the feeding tube and his jaw will remained wired for another 6 weeks, but he is definitely on the mend. We are proud of the little guy! UPDATE! February 2, 2015 Well, Bart surprised us today by taking his first bites of food since coming to our facility on January 23. This is a very good sign of his continued recovery. Because he is unable to eat enough food to sustain him, he will still need his feeding tube for several more weeks. He receives feedings every 4 hours through the tube to ensure that he is getting enough nutrients. We are so proud of this brave boy! UPDATE! February 2, 2015 Bart is resting comfortably this morning but is still unable to eat on his own. Our Director of Medical Operations believes he will need his feeding tube for a few more weeks until his jaw and palate are completely healed. UPDATE! January 30, 2105 New Information About Bart: Recently we have learned new information about Barts home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial. Therefore, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay does not intend to return Bart to the Hutson family. We are prepared to fight for the best interests of this cat. We hope the Hutson family will do the right thing and surrender Bart to our care so that we can find an appropriate environment for him to live out his life. The Humane Society of Tampa Bays Save-A-Pet Medical Fund, along with donations for Bart that we have received from generous individuals all over the world, will cover the cost of all medical care required and will help replenish our Save-A-Pet fund for other animals in need. We are not asking the Huston family for any money to cover any costs. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay had no involvement with the creation of the GoFundMe campaign set up to cover the cost of Barts medical care, nor have we received any funds from the account to date. Again, Barts medical costs are being covered by our own Save-A-Pet Medical Fund. Our concern is for Barts future. As always, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay is dedicated to the plight of companion animals in our area and strives to protect and promote their best interests at all times. UPDATE! January 28, 2015 Bart was struggling due to anemia. One of our shelter cats, Draco, was the donor for a blood transfusion to help Bart feel better. The transfusion went well and both cats are happy and resting comfortably. UPDATE! January 28, 2015 Bart came through his surgery very well and is resting comfortably in our care. He will be able to go home in 5-7 days once he is able to eat on his own. Full recovery will take about six weeks. He is a brave boy! UPDATE! January 27, 2015 Bart will be having surgery to repair his jaw and remove his eye today. We have seen many amazing cases at our full-service veterinary clinic, but this situation may take the cake! Our public hospital is currently caring for Bart, a 1.5 year old cat who was found by his owner after being hit by a car. The cat appeared to be lifeless and the owner buried him. Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbors yard, alive! He had dug himself out of the grave and slowly made his way back home, albeit weak, dehydrated and in need of medical attention. The owner reached out to area veterinary clinics but, unable to afford their fees, brought him to the our Animal Health Center where he is being treated for a broken jaw, open facial wounds and a ruined eye, which will have to be removed. Luckily, the injuries sustained were not more serious. HSTB veterinarians expect him to recover and be able to go back home.

The paper added that ""the sisters did not want to add anything else, without explaining even if the woman has or has not taken vows.""

Appunto lamentava dolori di pancia ma lecografia ha svelato il mistero e il medico di turno ha invitato suora e consorelle a prendere subito la strada del reparto di ostetricia non senza un attimo di imbarazzo. Sacco amniotico rotto e equipe subito in azione per far partorire la suora.Della storia, ovviamente, si sa ben poco anche se la stessa ci ha messo un nulla a fare il giro del paese e a uscire allo scoperto non solo dall'ovattato silenzio assicurato da personale medico e infermieristico che ha assistito al lieto evento ma anche da quello, pi religioso in questo caso, del convento che sembrerebbe essere addirittura un monastero di clausura della zona (a San Severino ce ne sono due, il convento di S.Caterina e quello di S.Chiara, entrambi nella zona del Catsello). Nulla trapela, ovviamente, sulla identit della religiosa, n sui tratti somatici del pargolo. Mistero sul fatto se somigli pi alla mamma piuttosto che al pap.E non chiedete se a venire al mondo sia stato un maschietto o una femminuccia visto che in corsia gli imbarazzi sono palpabili. Si sa solo che la mamma del nascituro, originaria di uno stato del sud America, sarebbe arrivata nel Maceratese da qualche tempo e avrebbe trovato alloggio, forse rifugio, in una struttura di clausura della nostra provincia.Difficile anche poter dire se la suora abbia o meno confessato il suo peccato, non certo veniale, alla sua superiora. Si sa per che la religiosa sarebbe arrivata prima al pronto soccorso, e successivamente sarebbe stata fatta salire in reparto, accompagnata da altre consorelle che, ancor prima di gridare al miracolo, avrebbero affidato alle preghiera del Signore chi nel frattempo stava per venire alla luce.L'ingresso all'accettazione  avvenuto domenica ed  stato, comunque, un gran giorno di festa per l'arrivo di una nuova vita. Cos, nell'imbarazzo veramente generale, sono state seguite dall'equipe che ha eseguito il parto le concitate fasi che hanno accompagnato lo stesso.Niente fiori all'ingresso della cameretta che in questi giorni ha permesso di garantire l'anonimato alla neo mamma che, comunque, sembra aver deciso di tenere il piccolo e che forse ora sar trasferita altrove, probabilmente in una casa famiglia.Di certo prima di domenica la suora non si sarebbe sottoposta a controlli, questo  quello che avrebbero raccontato le religiose che con lei hanno condiviso la clausura negli ultimi mesi. E di certo nella struttura che la ospitava, la suora difficilmente avrebbe potuto aver avuto contatti con il mondo esterno. Anche se le vie del Signore, si sa, sono veramente infinite.Non stup, mesi fa, la notizia del parto di un'altra suora, stavolta congolese. Il bimbo venuto alla luce fu dapprima affidato a una coppia di Tolentino e poi tolto ai genitori adottivi con un provvedimento inatteso e inaspettato della Suprema Corte per finire affidato a una casa d'accoglienza.In quel caso la mamma naturale aveva abbandonato la pargoletta alla nascita.

(Photo: Screen capture from YouTube video) It's not every night that a pizza delivery driver receives a $2,000 tip. But that's what happened Thursday to one Ann Arbor driver who delivered a single pizza to a conference room full of more than 200 realtors from Michigan and northern Ohio on Thursday. Pizza House delivery manager Brian LeFevre said he received a call Thursday morning from a man who said they wanted one pizza delivered to the Sheraton Hotel in Ann Arbor. ""They said they wanted it at 2:20 p.m. on the dot,"" LeFevre said. ""I gave it to our delivery driver and he went down there and took it to the front desk."" LeFevre said his driver was escorted to a conference room where a man was up front with a microphone. A video posted on YouTube shows the deliverer being stopped as he handed over the pizza and then presented with $2,084, letters of encouragement, a Visa gift card and lottery tickets -- all to cheers from the crowd. LeFevre said the driver, who identifies himself as Rob in the video but whose last name wasn't released, has worked at the restaurant about six years. When he came back, LeFevre said, Rob was visibly happy. ""He was clearly pretty ecstatic about something so I asked him what's going on,"" Le said. ""He said, 'I just had a life-changing delivery.' He was kind of blown away."" LeFevre said he's never seen a driver earn such a large tip. ""For one pizza, that's a pretty good day's work,"" he said. ""It's nice to be appreciated."" Stacey McVey, team leader of Keller Williams Greater Cleveland West, said that at the company's annual conference, all the agents agreed to pitch in to show someone from the service industry their appreciation. ""Our company as a whole is very interested in doing things like that,"" she said. ""It's really important as businesses that we give back. We believe a group of people can come together and change a life and cause other people to think about how to change others' lives. People in the service industry, I think they're pretty under-appreciated. It's a lot of fun to do something like this."" McVey said when the driver realized what was going on, it was a priceless moment. ""He was a little stunned,"" she said. ""Everyone was excited and you could kind of feel the energy in the room.

",http://empirenews.net/accused-boston-marathon-bomber-severely-injured-in-prison-may-never-walk-or-talk-again/,No Error,"0 FORT DEVENS, Massachusetts  Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 22, was the victim of an unfortunate accident yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just a few short months after his high-profile trial and sentencing, according to warden Paul Jacobson. Corrections officers reportedly found the terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby. It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere  all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma, said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev. Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber, said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us Thank you. Well, Youre welcome. Youre welcome, Boston. Youre welcome, America! Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence, said warden Jacobson. Because of the nature of Tsarnaevs crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Tsarnaev had pled not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him, but was found guilty on all counts in April. He was sentenced to the death penalty per the crimes committed. 0 Comments comments","Boston Marathon Bomber Tsarnaev Severely Injured In Prison, May Never Walk Or Talk Again",,Raoul Stockton

She also used the meat of the cats to lure other cats who unwittingly were eating their own species, a disgusting and cruel hobby admits local PETA spokeswoman Jane Churchill. I cant believe these atrocities happened in our own backyard. Animals are our brothers and sisters and what she has done to my eyes is comparable to mass murder she explains. She has taken the lives of hundreds of cats just to make fur coats out of them, this is tragic. How would people react if someone made coats out of human skin? These cats are living beings and all living beings are equal to Mother Earth.

Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015. According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earths own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect. Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation. Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95 wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earths crust is maximum even at their closest approach. But dont get too excited. If you think youll be able to float around your house, youre wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.

ONeill was uninjured, the five intruders all suffered injuries and remain hospitalized, but are expected to make a full recovery. Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm. Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men, part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips, were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house, with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of ONeills. Mr. ONeill had just turned in for the night, but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. ONeill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. ONeill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house! commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled. ONeill had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist Kevin Williamson interviewed the celebrated war hero. It was nothing really. Those kids didnt have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did, but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed. Those boys really did a number on the door jamb, ONeill stated. The neighbor who was the intended target seems to have abandoned home and has not been found by police.

The elves have basic mobility, which isnt a problem because when one shows up someplace unexpected, Snowden added, its just assumed to be part of the game.
